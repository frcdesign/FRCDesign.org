# FRCDesignLib

<center><img src="../images/frcdesignlib-banner.webp"></center>

FRCDesignLib is a library of FRC COTS components and assemblies maintained by the community. The typical way to use it is through the FRCDesignApp, which allows you to insert or derive those components into your documents easily.


## Installing FRCDesignApp

FRCDesignApp is a plugin for Onshape that allows you to use a large library of parts that are useful when designing for FRC.

!!! Tip
    FRCDesignApp is the plugin/app that helps you insert components into your documents, while FRCDesignLib is the actual collection of components. FRCDesignApp may get upgraded to include more functionality in the future.

To install it, go to the [FRCDesignApp page](https://appstore.onshape.com/apps/Manufacturers%20Models/2ZT7X5D646R3LM3ZND7LGBTYRVM4SVH6CDDGM6I=/description "FRCDesignApp Store Page"){:target="_blank"} in the Onshape Appstore.

Press "Subscribe", then "Get for Free". This will automatically add the FRCDesignApp to your Onshape account.

!!! Note
    After subscribing, the FRCDesignLib inserter won't show up in already open documents until you reload. This is a first-time thing though.

## Contributing to the Library
To maintain the high quality of library components, the contribution process requires some standards to be followed (all of which are documented). Join the Discord below to help out with component and/or app development and to access the contribution resources.
