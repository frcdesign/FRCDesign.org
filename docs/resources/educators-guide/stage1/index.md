# Stage 1 Overview

Stage 1 establishes foundational CAD skills through a carefully structured progression of learning materials and exercises. The stage is designed to build competence and confidence gradually while maintaining student engagement through FRC-relevant content.

## Teaching Approach
The stage uses a multi-pronged approach combining:
- Onshape's professional learning center courses for core CAD concepts
- Custom FRC-specific exercises that immediately apply these concepts
- Progressive reduction in step-by-step guidance to develop independence
- Introduction of FRC-specific tools and best practices

## Stage Structure

### Stage 1A: CAD Fundamentals
Students begin with Onshape's learning center courses covering basic sketching, part modeling, and assemblies. These courses provide professional-grade CAD instruction while minimizing educator workload. The following exercises then contextualize these skills through FRC-relevant tasks like modeling box tubes and gussets. Key learning objectives include:

- Basic sketching and part modeling techniques
- Understanding constraints and design intent
- Using Featurescripts for common FRC modeling tasks
- Assembly basics and mate types

!!! warning
    The Onshape learning course material is essential for ensuring students understand the fundamental tools of Onshape and should not be skipped! If students are already familiar with the basic Onshape they tools they can skip this section, however if they are stumbling with basic tasks it might be a good idea to run them through the Onshape learning center for a refresher.

### Stage 1B: Power Transmission Basics
This section introduces mechanical concepts through straightforward power transmission exercises. Students learn about:

- Speed and torque relationships
- Mechanical advantage through gear/belt/chain ratios
- Basic gearbox modeling
- Using the MKCad parts library for COTS components

### Stage 1C: Practice Mechanisms
A series of increasingly complex mechanism exercises helps students develop fluency and independence. Each exercise introduces new COTS components and design techniques while reinforcing previous concepts. The gradual reduction in step-by-step instructions encourages problem-solving skills.

### Stage 1D: Design Methodology
The final section teaches the top-down design approach used in FRC robot design. Students learn:

- Creating and using layout sketches
- Organizing robot assemblies effectively 
- Basic integration considerations
- Modeling a complete swerve drivebase

## Teaching Tips
- Encourage use of the exercise solution documents for self-checking work
- Ask us questions your students have that you are unable to answer in the discord server.
- Emphasize organization and best practices throughout to build good habits
- Don't be afraid to have students complete the exercises multiple times through to build proficiency

The stage is designed to provide approximately 20-30 hours of instruction and practice, though timing may vary based on student experience and aptitude.
