# Stage 1E - Subsystem Workflow

Stage 1E teaches students how to fully detail a drivetrain assembly by adding necessary components like battery mounting, electronics, and bumpers. This stage bridges the gap between basic modeling and creating manufacture-ready designs.

## Learning Objectives

Students who complete Stage 1E will:
- Understand requirements for core robot systems (battery, electronics, bumpers)
- Learn practical design considerations for component mounting
- Practice creating complete, manufacture-ready assemblies
- Develop systematic approaches to detailing assemblies
- Apply FRC rules and requirements to designs

## Teaching Structure

### Project Phases

1. Battery Mounting
- Safety requirements
- Center of gravity considerations
- Mounting methods
- Access requirements

2. Electronics Layout
- Core components overview
- Wiring considerations
- Accessibility needs

3. Bumper Design
- Game manual requirements
- Mounting systems
- Material considerations

## Teaching Tips

### Practical Considerations

Emphasize real-world factors:
- Maintenance access
- Wire routing paths
- Quick replacement needs
- Competition considerations

### FRC-Specific Requirements

Review relevant rules:
- Battery mounting requirements
- Electronics placement rules
- Bumper specifications
- Safety considerations

### Design Validation

Teach students to verify:
- Component clearances
- Access for maintenance
- Rule compliance

## Common Challenges

Address typical issues:
- Overcrowded electronics layouts
- Poor maintenance access
- Bad mounting options

## Assessment Strategies

Evaluate understanding through:
- Practical accessibility
- Assembly organization
- Documentation quality
- Design justification

## Resources

Provide access to:
- FRC Game Manual
- Electronics documentation
- COTS component specs

## Extension Activities

For advanced students:
- Design alternative mounting solutions
- Try out different battery positions
- Compare bumper mounting methods

## Success Indicators

Students demonstrate competency when they:
- Meet all FRC requirements
- Create serviceable designs
- Provide adequate access to all critical components
- Justify design decisions

This framework helps students understand the practical aspects of robot design while maintaining focus on creating competition-ready solutions. Regular design reviews and practical considerations help ensure designs are both functional and compliant.
