# Stage 1D - Design Methodology

Stage 1D introduces students to top-down design methodology through creating a swerve drivebase. This stage represents a significant shift from modeling individual mechanisms to understanding holistic robot design principles.

## Learning Objectives

Students who complete Stage 1D will:
- Understand and apply top-down design methodology using layout sketches
- Learn to use layout sketches to drive parametric part design
- Practice integrating COTS components (swerve modules) into a larger assembly
- Develop systematic approaches to complex mechanism design
- Learn proper origin placement and reference geometry techniques

## Teaching Structure 

### Design Process Introduction

Begin with a thorough introduction to top-down design methodology:
1. Explain the concept of layout sketches and their importance
2. Demonstrate how layout sketches drive part geometry
3. Show examples of good vs poor design intent capture
4. Review the importance of consistent origin placement

### Project Phases

1. Layout Sketching
- Creating reference geometry
- Understanding drive layout requirements
- Practicing parametric dimensioning

2. Part Modeling
- Deriving geometry from layout sketches
- Creating frame components
- Modeling the bellypan

3. Assembly Creation
- Organizing assembly structure
- Integrating COTS components
- Proper constraint techniques

## Teaching Tips

### Key Concepts to Emphasize

Layout Sketches
- Importance of fully defined sketches
- Using construction geometry effectively
- Creating parametric relationships
- Proper dimension placement

Origin Placement
- Consistent origin location across documents
- Using the Origin Cube properly
- Importance for robot code integration

Design Intent
- Making designs parametric
- Capturing mechanical relationships
- Planning for future modifications

### Common Challenges

Watch for these typical stumbling points:
- Over-complicated layout sketches
- Incorrect origin placement
- Non-parametric modeling approaches
- Disorganized assembly structure

### Assessment Strategies

Monitor understanding through:
- Quality of layout sketches
- Parametric nature of models
- Assembly organization
- Design intent capture
- Ability to modify designs efficiently (How hard is it to change frame perimeter)

## Troubleshooting Guide

Common Issues and Solutions:
- Layout sketch breaks when modified: Review constraint relationships
- Parts don't update with layout changes: Check derived geometry setup
- Assembly constraints fail: Review mating scheme and origin placement
- Poor performance: Check assembly organization and feature tree structure

## Success Criteria

Students demonstrate mastery when they can:
- Create clear, parametric layout sketches
- Model parts that update properly with layout changes
- Organize assemblies efficiently
- Explain their design decisions
- Make modifications without breaking relationships

## Implementation Tips

Document Setup
- Create template files with proper origin setup
- Establish naming conventions
- Set up standard folder structures

Workflow Management
- Break tasks into manageable chunks
- Use checkpoints to verify progress

Top down design is core to FRC Design and CAD, these fundamentals will be expanded upon later in the course.
