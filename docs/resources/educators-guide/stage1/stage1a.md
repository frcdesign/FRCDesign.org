# Stage 1A: CAD Fundamentals 

## Overview
Stage 1A introduces students to fundamental CAD skills through a combination of Onshape's learning courses and FRC-specific exercises. This dual approach ensures students learn proper CAD techniques while maintaining engagement through robotics-relevant applications.

## Learning Objectives
Students will learn to:
- Create and constrain basic sketches
- Model simple parts using features like extrude and fillet
- Work with multiple parts in a single part studio
- Create basic assemblies with mates
- Use FRC-specific Featurescripts
- Follow proper naming and organization practices

## Teaching Structure

### 1. Onshape Learning Courses
Have students complete these courses in order:
- Introduction to Sketching
- Part Design Using Part Studios
- Multi-Part Part Studios
- Onshape Assemblies

Expected completion time: 2-4 hours per course

### 2. Practice Exercises
Four guided exercises that apply course concepts to FRC components:
1. Simple Box Tube: Basic sketching and feature creation
2. Box Tube and Gusset Joint: Multiple parts in one studio
3. Box Tube Frame: Using Featurescripts for FRC 
4. Climber Hook: Complex sketching and assembly practices

Expected completion time: 30-45 minutes per exercise

## Teaching Tips

### Learning Courses
- Ensure students complete course exercises, not just watch videos
- Consider reviewing common misconceptions after each course
- Encourage use of keyboard shortcuts early for efficiency, if someone asks how to do something try and tell them the hotkey for it in addition to where it is on the toolbar.
- Emphasize proper sketch constraints and design intent if possible (no random dimensions)

### Practice Exercises  
- Review exercise solutions beforehand to understand key concepts
- Have students check their work against solution files
- Pay attention to organization and naming conventions
- Ensure students fully constrain their sketches
- Encourage use of construction geometry for better design intent

### Common Student Challenges
- Understanding sketch constraints and degrees of freedom
- Properly organizing features and parts
- Deciding when to use separate sketches vs. one sketch
- Determining correct mate types in assemblies

## Resources
- Exercise solution files for reference
- Discord server for technical questions
- Onshape's help documentation

## Assessment
Student work should demonstrate:
- Fully constrained sketches
- Proper feature and part organization
- Correct use of Featurescripts
- Understanding of design intent
- Basic assembly competence

Expected time to complete Stage 1A: 3-5 hours depending on student experience and aptitude.
