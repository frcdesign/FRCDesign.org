# Introduction
FRCDesign.org is a comprehensive, self-paced course designed to teach FRC robot design and CAD skills. This guide aims to help educators effectively implement the course and support their students throughout the learning process. The course assumes minimal prior knowledge of physics or math, making it accessible to students from various backgrounds. It focuses on developing knowledge through a blend of concepts and example projects.

## Structure and Approach
The course is built on several key principles. It emphasizes self-paced learning, allowing students to progress at their own speed. A scaffolded approach is used, with gradually reduced handholding as students advance. The focus is on FRC-specific design and CAD skills, utilizing a 2D plate with patterned box tube design style. Throughout the course, there is a strong emphasis on parametric design practices. The overall progression of the course moves from learning FRC-specific CAD and power transmission basics to designing individual mechanisms. Students then learn to integrate these mechanisms into full robot designs, and finally master advanced concepts and specialize based on their interests.
