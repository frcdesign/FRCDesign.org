# The Stages
Stage 0: Introduction to CAD

- Introduces CAD and its importance in FRC
- Teaches how to set up Onshape accounts and install essential Featurescripts and MKCad
- Covers basic CAD theory and concepts like sketches and features
- Explains Onshape interface navigation and Documents Page

Stage 1A: Onshape Fundamentals

- Teaches basic sketching and part modeling through FRC-relevant exercises
- Introduces mechanisms like tubes, gussets, and basic structural components
- Covers assembly basics and mate types
- Focuses on proper organization and naming conventions

Stage 1B: Power Transmissions  

- Introduces the origin cube
- Introduces motors, shafts, bearings and power transmission components
- Covers gear ratios, belt/chain drives, and mechanical advantage concepts
- Provides exercises modeling simple gearboxes and power transmission assemblies, using origin cube functions 

Stage 1C: Practice Mechanisms

- Provides increasingly complex mechanism exercises with decreasing guidance
- Includes mechanisms like shooters, intakes, and indexers
- Introduces more COTS components and assembly techniques

Stage 1D: Design Methodology - Simple Swerve Drivebase

- Introduces top-down design methodology using layout sketches
- Teaches proper origin placement and use of the Origin Cube
- Walks through designing a basic swerve drive chassis
- Covers organization of top-level robot assemblies

Stage 1E: Subsystem Workflow - Detailing the Drivebase

- Covers the process of fully detailing a drivebase subsystem
- Includes battery mounting, electronics placement, and bumper design
- Teaches proper cable routing and component organization
- Focuses on making assemblies manufacturable and maintainable

Stage 2A: Basic Shooter

- Covers design of a flywheel shooter mechanism
- Teaches concepts of compression, wrap, and exit velocity
- Includes friction reduction and efficiency optimization
- Provides practical shooter design workflow

Stage 2B: Dead Axle Pivot

- Teaches design of robust pivot mechanisms
- Covers concepts of friction, strength, and backlash
- Includes proper bearing/bushing selection
- Shows organization of moving assemblies

Stage 2C: Slapdown Intake

- Covers design of an over-the-bumper intake mechanism
- Teaches intake design best practices and "golden rules"
- Introduces concepts like zombie axles
- Shows organization of complex moving assemblies

Stage 2D: Cascade Elevator

- Teaches design of cascade vs continuous elevators
- Covers proper rigging, cable management, and tensioning
- Includes elevator block selection and implementation
- Shows organization of multi-stage linear motion assemblies

The course progressively builds complexity while reinforcing core concepts of CAD organization, mechanism design, and engineering best practices. It starts with basic CAD skills and culminates in complete complex mechanism designs.
