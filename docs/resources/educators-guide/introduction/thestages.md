# The Stages

## Stage 0
Setup (Estimated time: 30 minutes)
The objectives of Stage 0 are to set up an Onshape account, install necessary Featurescripts and MKCad, and familiarize students with basic Onshape navigation. Verification for this stage involves ensuring students have completed setup and can access their Onshape account.

## Stage 1 Fundamentals (Estimated time: 8-16 hours)
Stage 1 has several prerequisites from the Onshape Learning Center, including courses on Introduction to Sketching, Part Design Using Part Studios, Multi-Part Part Studios, and Onshape Assemblies. These prerequisites typically take 3-7 hours to complete, but are essential if a student is starting from 0 Onshape Experience.

The stage itself is divided into five modules:

- 1A focuses on basic FRC part modeling

- 1B covers power transmissions

- 1C introduces top-down design with simple layout sketches, and teaches a wide variety of FRC  Concepts through simple example projects.

- 1D goes into the overal structure of an FRC Robot's CAD model, from master sketching to the top     level assembly. These concepts are taught through the process of modeling a simple Swerve Drivebase

- 1E teaches the general subsystem CAD workflow through adding onto the drivebase started in the prior module.

Verification for Stage 1 involves checking project completion in the classroom, and making sure assemblies look right.
Following Stage 1, there is a transition period to Stage 2 consisting of 10 practice projects designed to reinforce CAD skills.

## Stage 2 Mechanism Design (Estimated time: 25-40 hours)
Stage 2 consists of four main projects: a Shooter based on the 2020 game, a Dead Axle Pivot, a Slap Down Intake for the 2022 game, and a Cascade Elevator. Verification is based on project completion and iteration. It's important to encourage students to seek feedback and make improvements to their designs.

## Stage 3: Full Robot Design
Stage 3 is currently under construction. This page will be updated when it is complete. Stage 3 is focused on mechanism integration, and the process of modeling entire cohesive robots.

## Stage 4: Advanced Design
Stage 4 is currently under construction. THis page will be updated when it is complte. Stage 4 represents ongoing learning and specialization based on student interests and team needs. There is no set curriculum for this stage, as it's meant to be flexible and adaptable.
