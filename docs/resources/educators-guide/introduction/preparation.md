# Preparation
The best thing you can do to prepare to use FRCDesign.org's Learning Course to teach your students is to go through the course yourself atleast through the end of Stage 2. This will help get you familiar with the material, and get you up to date on the latest Onshape FRC workflows. It is also reccomended to refresh yourself every so often with the material incase information has been modified since the last time you taught the course.

## Onshape Classroom
Setting up an Onshape Classroom is a great way to track student progress. Setting up assingments for the various exercises also makes it easy to review the work studentsh have done, if you need to treat exersises as graded assignments.

## Advice
Students can learn at very different paces. Structure your teaching in a way that lets students work at their own speed. Become a walking encyclopedia of the learning course stages, even if its just the section most of your students are currently on, and encourage asking you for help. There are alot of new concepts to learn here, and most will not understand these concepts on the first pass. Being able to clear up confusion quickly is key to success.
