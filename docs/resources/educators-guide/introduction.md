# FRCDesign.org Educator's Guide

## Introduction
FRCDesign.org is a comprehensive, self-paced course designed to teach FRC robot design and CAD skills. This guide aims to help educators effectively implement the course and support their students throughout the learning process. The course assumes minimal prior knowledge of physics or math, making it accessible to students from various backgrounds. It focuses on developing knowledge through a blend of concepts and example projects.

## Structure and Approach
The course is built on several key principles. It emphasizes self-paced learning, allowing students to progress at their own speed. A scaffolded approach is used, with gradually reduced handholding as students advance. The focus is on FRC-specific design and CAD skills, utilizing a 2D plate with patterned box tube design style. Throughout the course, there is a strong emphasis on parametric design practices. The overall progression of the course moves from learning FRC-specific CAD and power transmission basics to designing individual mechanisms. Students then learn to integrate these mechanisms into full robot designs, and finally master advanced concepts and specialize based on their interests.

## The Stages

### Stage 0
Setup (Estimated time: 30 minutes)
The objectives of Stage 0 are to set up an Onshape account, install necessary Featurescripts and MKCad, and familiarize students with basic Onshape navigation. Verification for this stage involves ensuring students have completed setup and can access their Onshape account.

### Stage 1 Fundamentals (Estimated time: 8-16 hours)
Stage 1 has several prerequisites from the Onshape Learning Center, including courses on Introduction to Sketching, Part Design Using Part Studios, Multi-Part Part Studios, and Onshape Assemblies. These prerequisites typically take 3-7 hours to complete, but are essential if a student is starting from 0 Onshape Experience.
The stage itself is divided into five modules:
1A focuses on basic FRC part modeling
1B covers power transmissions
1C introduces top-down design with simple layout sketches, and teaches a wide variety of FRC Concepts through simple example projects.
1D goes into the overal structure of an FRC Robot's CAD model, from master sketching to the top level assembly.
1E teaches the general subsystem CAD workflow through adding onto

Verification for Stage 1 involves checking project completion in the classroom, using version history and edit logs to ensure authenticity of work.
Following Stage 1, there is a transition period to Stage 2 consisting of 10 practice projects designed to reinforce CAD skills.

### Stage 2 Mechanism Design (Estimated time: 25-40 hours)
Stage 2 consists of four main projects: a Shooter based on the 2020 game, a Dead Axle Pivot, a Slap Down Intake for the 2022 game, and a Cascade Elevator. Verification is based on project completion and iteration. It's important to encourage students to seek feedback and make improvements to their designs.

### Stage 3: Full Robot Design
Stage 3 is currently under construction. This page will be updated when it is complete. Stage 3 is focused on mechanism integration, and the process of modeling entire cohesive robots.

### Stage 4: Advanced Design
Stage 4 is currently under construction. THis page will be updated when it is complte. Stage 4 represents ongoing learning and specialization based on student interests and team needs. There is no set curriculum for this stage, as it's meant to be flexible and adaptable.
