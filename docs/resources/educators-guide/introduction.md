# FRCDesign.org Educator's Guide

## Introduction
The FRCDesign.org Learning Course is a self-paced, comprehensive program that teaches FRC robot design and CAD skills. This guide is intended to help educators effectively implement the course while supporting their students throughout the learning process. Designed for accessibility, the course requires minimal prior knowledge of physics or math, making it suitable for students from various backgrounds. The emphasis is on building knowledge through consistent practice and review.

## Structure and Approach
The course is built for self-paced learning, where students can progress at their own speed. It can either be used for motivated students to self-teach or in a more classroom-esque setting where it's led by student design leads or mentors.

In an classroom-esque setting, students must still be allowed to go through the course at their own pace. Different people will have different starting points and different things they don't understand or struggle with. Going at a set pace may cause some students to be bored and others to struggle and fall behind. 

The ideal setup is for educators to offload the curriculum (concepts, exercises, projects) to the website, freeing them up to give more individualized help and review to each student. This is similar to a flipped classroom setting, but preferably meeting time or class time is given for students to do the work and for educators to review and catch mistakes as students are working through exercises and projects.

Students will be able to focus on what they need to improve on through a mix of self-review and external review. They may choose to do their own custom mechanisms to practice specific skills or learn how to design a specific mechanism; this is great. Make sure to help review these as well, because often external review or resources are more important for these because they don't have a specific reference for knowledge inside of the course.

The content itself is focused on teaching CAD through FRC-relevant exercises, where new skills and concepts are introduced in each exercise or project. Each section has a bit of explanation on the concepts or skills being introduced in the exercises, with the guidance for the exercises gradually decreasing in guidance to help students get more confident with using the software.

The progression of the course moves from learning how to use the software (while using and teaching FRC-relevant skills and engineering such as COTS parts and power transmissions) to designing whole individual mechanisms, teaching mechanism design along the way. Students will then learn how to integrate these mechanisms into full robot designs. More detailed information on each topic will be given in the Design Handbook for students or educators to use for extra information, but that's out of the scope of the course.

The design style focused on utilizes 2-D plates and patterned box tube, possibly the lowest resource design style with the highest ceiling, as you can get plates cut using a service such as Fabworks and cut the tubes and shafts using just a hacksaw. Since the purpose of robot design is to make it easy for the team to manufacture, build, program, and drive the robot, the design style chosen makes it as easy as possible to have a tight schedule and prioritize making the robot work well and drive well.

## The Stages

### Stage 0
Setup (Estimated time: 30 minutes)
The objectives of Stage 0 are to set up an Onshape account, install necessary Featurescripts and MKCad, and familiarize students with basic Onshape navigation. Verification for this stage involves ensuring students have completed setup and can access their Onshape account.

### Stage 1 Fundamentals (Estimated time: 8-16 hours)
Stage 1 has several prerequisites from the Onshape Learning Center, including courses on Introduction to Sketching, Part Design Using Part Studios, Multi-Part Part Studios, and Onshape Assemblies. These prerequisites typically take 3-7 hours to complete, but are essential if a student is starting from 0 Onshape Experience.
The stage itself is divided into five modules:
1A focuses on basic FRC part modeling
1B covers power transmissions
1C introduces top-down design with simple layout sketches, and teaches a wide variety of FRC Concepts through simple example projects.
1D goes into the overal structure of an FRC Robot's CAD model, from master sketching to the top level assembly.
1E teaches the general subsystem CAD workflow through adding onto

Verification for Stage 1 involves checking project completion in the classroom, using version history and edit logs to ensure authenticity of work.
Following Stage 1, there is a transition period to Stage 2 consisting of 10 practice projects designed to reinforce CAD skills.

### Stage 2 Mechanism Design (Estimated time: 25-40 hours)
Stage 2 consists of four main projects: a Shooter based on the 2020 game, a Dead Axle Pivot, a Slap Down Intake for the 2022 game, and a Cascade Elevator. Verification is based on project completion and iteration. It's important to encourage students to seek feedback and make improvements to their designs.

### Stage 3: Full Robot Design
Stage 3 is currently under construction. This page will be updated when it is complete. Stage 3 is focused on mechanism integration, and the process of modeling entire cohesive robots.

### Stage 4: Advanced Design
Stage 4 is currently under construction. THis page will be updated when it is complte. Stage 4 represents ongoing learning and specialization based on student interests and team needs. There is no set curriculum for this stage, as it's meant to be flexible and adaptable.
