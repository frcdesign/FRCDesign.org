## Sections

### [Glossary](glossary.md)
The glossary is a compiled list of words (including acronyms and abbreviations) and definitions to help people understand the lingo used in various parts of the website and on the discord server. When you find one of these words across the site, it will be underlined, and you can hover over it to see the definition.

### [Strategic Design](strategicDesignResources.md)
A collection of strategic design resources to help your team learn how to analyze a game and choose an archetype that is strategically viable and a good fit for your capabilities.

### CAD Resources
A collection of resources to support your workflow in Onshape, relevant to FRC.

[**Featurescripts**](featurescripts.md): A list of FRC-relevant featurescripts and how to add them (includes some short tutorial videos).

[**Simplified Models**](simplified.md): A collection of simplified models of COTS parts to reduce load time (see the importance of this in [assembly best practices](../best-practices/assembly-setup.md)). These are also already mostly added to [MKCAD](https://appstore.onshape.com/apps/Manufacturers%20Models/2ZT7X5D646R3LM3ZND7LGBTYRVM4SVH6CDDGM6I=/description).

[**Configurables**](configurables.md): A collection of configurable parts or assemblies that aren't in MKCAD that could assist your design.

[**KrayonCAD**](krayonCAD.md): A resource now integrated with MKCAD that allows people to quickly model out robot architectures.
