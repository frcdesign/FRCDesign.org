This section includes resources that you may find useful to help improve your knowledge of mechanisms, help you understand the rest of the site better, and assist your CAD workflow.

## Sections

### [Glossary](glossary.md "Glossay Page")
The glossary is a compiled list of words (including acronyms and abbreviations) and definitions to help people understand the lingo used in various parts of the website and on the discord server. When you find one of these words across the site, it will be underlined, and you can hover over it to see the definition.

### CAD Resources
A collection of resources to support your workflow in Onshape, relevant to FRC.

[**Featurescripts**](featurescripts.md "Featurescripts Page"): A list of FRC-relevant featurescripts and how to add them (includes some short tutorial videos).

[**Simplified Models**](simplified.md "Simplified Models Page"): A collection of simplified models of COTS parts to reduce load time (see the importance of this in [assembly best practices](../best-practices/assembly-setup.md "Assembly Best Practices Page")). These have been already mostly added to the [MKCAD App](https://appstore.onshape.com/apps/Manufacturers%20Models/2ZT7X5D646R3LM3ZND7LGBTYRVM4SVH6CDDGM6I=/description "MKCad App"){:target="_blank"}.

[**Configurables**](configurables.md "Configurable Parts Page"): A collection of configurable parts or assemblies that aren't in MKCAD that could assist your design.

[**KrayonCAD**](krayonCAD.md "KrayonCAD Page"): A resource now integrated with MKCAD that allows people to quickly model out robot architectures.
