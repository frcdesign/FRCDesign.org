# Welcome to the Glossary

## Why this exists.
We know it can be hard learning each and every term thrown around in FRC design, so we have compiled a list of words and definitions to aide you throughout your learning.

## Terms
`c-c`
:   "Center to Center" distance

`WCP`
:   ["West Coast Products"](https://wcproducts.com/)

`TTB`
:   ["The Thrifty Bot"](https://www.thethriftybot.com/)

`SDS`
:   ["Swerve Drive Specialties"](https://www.swervedrivespecialties.com/)

`Turnbuckle`
:   A threaded part that goes in between chain links to tension the chain

`COG`
:   Center of Gravity, also referred to as COM(Center of Mass)

`OTB`
:   "Over the Bumper" typically used to refer to a style of intake where you lift the piece over the bumper

`UTB`
:   "Under the Bumper" typically used to refer to a style of intake where you move the piece under the bumper

`V4B`
:   "Virtual 4 Bar" is where a second degree of freedom is directly geared of a previous degree of freedom instead of being moved independently or by a linkage.

`4Bar`
:   A type of linkage characterized by its 4 pivot points

`COTS`
:   "Commercial Off the Shelf" parts are anything you can buy from a vendor.

`Dead Axle`
:   A type of axle setup where the axle is fixed in place and or is not transferring the torque of the system through it.

`Live Axle`
:   A type of axle setup where the main torque transfer is through the axle

`Zombie Axle`
:   Typically used on pivots a zombie axle spins with the mechanism, but is transferring little to no torque through it. This is commonly used to put an encoder on the pivot point.

`Tube Nut`
: Also known as a "Star Nut", these provide an easy way to put a thread in end of a hollow tube allowing you to bolt the tube to another part. 

`Cantilever`
: Horizontal Element that's supported by one side only.

`Shear`
: When forces are applied parallel to the plane of a material, causing breaking of fasteners due to excessive force and stress.

`Torque`
: Force that produces rotational movement.

`Moment of Inertia`
: Amount of resistance against angular acceleration.

`End Effector`
:   Mechanism attached to the end of an arm.

`Linear Actuator`
:   Device that converts rotational movement to linear motion, usually with a lead screw.

`PDH`
:   Power Distribution Hub.

`SparkMAX`
:   Motor controller for REV motors.

`Main Breaker`
:   Switch for the robot.

`PWM`
:   Pulse Width Modulation cable.

`RIO`
:   RoboRIO, brain of the robot.

`Blinkn`
:   LED controller for REV.

`Radio`
:   Device that helps the robot communicate with the driver station.

`Limit Switch`
:   Type of sensor that acts as a soft limit when physically or magnetically hit.

`Throughbore Encoder`
:   An encoder that allows shafts to pass through its center to record position. 

`Magnetic Encoder`
:   An encoder that uses magnetic fields to measure position or motion. 

`3DP`
:   Abbreviation for 3D printed or 3D printing.

`Billet`
:   Component machined down from a solid block of material.

`Bevel Gear`
:   Special gears that change the axis of rotation, typically by 90 degrees.

`Gusset`
:   Reinforcement plate, usually made of aluminum, used to strengthen connections between two tubes.

`Box Tube`
:   Hollow, square or rectangular metal tubing.

`Tie Rod`
:   Rigid bar used for structural support and stability, often in the frame of a robot.

`Poly/PC`
:   Abbreviation for polycarbonate.

`Stripping`
:   Process of removing threads or bolt heads, often due to excessive force or wear.

`Cross Threading`
:   Damage caused when a fastener is forced at an incorrect angle during assembly.

`Tapping`
:   The process of creating threads in a hole using a tap tool.

`Brainpan`
:   Flipped electronics bellypan.

`Bellypan`
:   Plate for mounting electronics on the underside of your drivebase.

`Hardstop`
:   A physical limit designed to prevent a mechanism or component from moving beyond a certain point.

`Softstop`
:   A software-based limit or control mechanism that restricts the movement of a mechanism or component to prevent it from exceeding certain parameters.

`DP`
:   Diametral pitch is the number of teeth per inch of the pitch circle.

`packaging`
:   The way in which you fit parts of your robot together in a space

`backlash`
:   'Slop' in a power transmission system; can wiggle back and forth without engaging the whole system

`parametric`
:   Designed in a way that uses relationships between steps to maintain design intent
