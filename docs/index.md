# Welcome to FRCDesign.org
FRCDesign.org is a comprehensive learning guide and technical reference for FRC design using Onshape.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :fontawesome-solid-flask-vial:{ .lg .middle } __Website Feature Guide__

    ---

    Explains the main features of the website. Recommended to go through before the learning course.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Website Feature Guide](website-feature-guide.md)

-   :material-book-open-variant:{ .lg .middle } __Learning Course__

    ---

    A guided curriculum through learning Onshape applied to robot design fundamentals. Looking to learn FRC robot design and CAD skills? Start here.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Learning Course](learning-course/index.md)

-   :material-bookshelf:{ .lg .middle } __Design Handbook__

    ---

    Dives into the concepts necessary in order to design a competitive robot. Unlike the learning course, this is primarily a reference wiki. 

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Design Handbook](design-handbook/index.md)

-   :material-robot:{ .lg .middle } __Mechanism Examples__

    ---

    Unlike other mechanism example collections, these are hand picked for specific concepts with detailed breakdowns behind each design.

-   :material-file-cad-box:{ .lg .middle } __CAD Best Practices__

    ---

    A reference for best practices to follow when you're modeling a robot in Onshape.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: CAD Best Practices](best-practices/index.md)

-   :material-book:{ .lg .middle } __Other Resources__

    ---

    Besides the other content on the website, we have a nice collection of resources (e.g. featurescripts and models).

## What is FRCDesign.org?

1. FRCDesign.org is not just a resource collection. Though it includes many resources, almost all of the website's content has been written specifically for the website to align with our goals.
2. Everything is taught from a competitive focus. Designing competitive robots helps inspire students and teach both engineering skills and life skills. It's also generally more fun when the robot performs well instead of breaking.
2. We don't try to teach everything. The learning course is built around teaching a single CAD software (Onshape), and we encourage a specific design style which is optimized for the majority of mid-resource teams. 
3. We try to include the small details that most guides forget. The concept of an "arm" is almost ubiquitous, but the concepts behind designing a pivot that works every match and never breaks? That's not so much common knowledge and much more important.
4. Design practices are important! We try to document and teach [the best practices possible](best-practices/index.md "Best Practices Page") so you can design faster during the season.  

## Who is FRCDesign.org?

FRCDesign.org is the culmination of hundreds of hours of work between a group of FIRST students, alumni, and mentors from teams all over the world.
