CAD is an acronym for "computer-aided design." It's a software tool used by engineers, manufacturers, architects, and many more designers in industry to bring their ideas to life. 

CAD is used to create a 3D model from various kinds of steps and tools to help prototype, manufacture, and market a product. Files can be sent to a machine to either print or cut material. Drawings can also be made and printed out to assist with manual machining and assembly.

## Different Software
There are many different kinds of CAD, usually designed for specific industries in mind. The kind of CAD an architect might use would be different from the kind of CAD engineers use. The tools required may be different as well.

Engineers mostly use parametric feature-based CAD, which includes programs like Autodesk Inventor and Fusion, SolidWorks, and Onshape. These programs can be designed around different workflows, but usually have similar features. It's important to learn the workflow for a specific program; often, they aren't exactly transferrable.

SolidWorks is the industry standard for many companies, Autodesk Inventor is also widely used, and Fusion and Onshape are sometimes used in the industry but much more popular for hobbyists.

## Why Use CAD?

CAD is the intermediary between an idea and a built product. Teams can iterate ideas before prototyping and manufacturing, and it helps cut down on prototyping time. Good CAD efficiency can help a team design a good robot in a timely manner, leaving room for software testing and drive practice.


1. Design your robot before you cut to make sure things will fit together and that you have the correct measurements. It is frustrating to realize you cut a part too short and need to recut an entirely new piece or when you need to drill random holes throughout your beautifully machined channel. 

2. While you may think your team is on the same page and has agreed upon a design, your whiteboard drawings may leave some room for interpretation. When you use CAD to model your design, everyone can see a mockup of the end result and agree on a design and direction. 

3. Team members that were more heavily involved in the design process or ideation may know how the robot should function and how to fabricate it. This can leave them doing the bulk of the work. Using CAD can help those team members explain to other team members what they can to do to help build the robot. 

4. Newer team members that have not been involved in a robotics season before may have no idea what components and processes are needed to build a robot. CAD can be a great teaching tool to show those team members what is needed on the robot so they can help with the process too!

5. The worst feeling is when you go to weigh your carefully constructed robot for the first time only to realize that it is 10 pounds overweight! You can measure your robot's size and weight in Onshape so you can make sure that it meets requirements. This gives you the opportunity to make changes before fabrication, such as using a pocketing feature to cut out excess material. 

6. CAD works like a digital blueprint and bill of materials of the robot. It can allow students to visualize the intricacies and precise dimensions in their mechanisms to make sure everything fits.

7. CAD skills are used in the real world all the time, when designing and testing anything from simple product design to large feats of engineering like planes or cars. Learning CAD with any CAD software can equip you with useful skills you can put on your resume, and it will allow you to learn other CAD software a little easier.

## Why Onshape for FRC?

### Collaboration
Onshape allows and is built around team collaboration better than any other CAD software. 

Most companies (or robotics teams) have to invest in Product Data Management (PDM) software or websites in order to manage files and versions. This requires a check-in check-out process to make sure the same file isn't being worked on by different people at the same time. In Onshape, multiple people can work on the same or different parts of the robot at the same time with no worry about revision management or a check-out process.

### Accessibility
Onshape is more easily accessible to people, especially high schoolers with limited resources. Education licenses are free and easy to get, and include all the features a team would need to design a competitive robot with a decently sized team. Anyone can pull it and any shared documents up on a browser if they have access to the internet, even on a Chromebook; Onshape does not require good hardware, but can still benefit from it anyways.

### Organization
Instead of files, Onshape uses documents that keep everything related to a project (e.g. a whole subsystem) in the same place, as opposed to having to keep track of many separate files that could possibly corrupt and cause you to lose data. 

### Features
Onshape has many features that benefit the FIRST Robotics design process and workflow, even disregarding the other topics mentioned. The design of the software itself encourages top-down design (where the general overview and architecture of a product are defined first, and the details are defined based on that), which makes team collaboration around a robot design easier. 

There are also several community-made tools to help FRC teams, including an extensive part and assembly library called MKCAD and many useful custom features that can save a lot of time.

## Other Softwares?

Onshape is only one of many CAD softwares. Many teams may choose not to use it because of prior student and mentor experience and resources with another software, or a workflow has already been established that works very well for a team with a different software. Onshape is by no means common in the engineering industry, so mentors are more likely to be able to guide a team well using other softwares. 

Depending on the circumstances, Onshape may not be the best fit for a team; however, this guide focuses on Onshape because of the above mentioned reasons for why it's so good for FRC, and the abundant other resources made for using Onshape for FRC. Much of the design process itself and many of the mechanism fundamentals and glossary still apply though, no matter what CAD software you're using.
