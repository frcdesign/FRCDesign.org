# 1A: Sketching & Part Design

<br>

Welcome to stage 1! Through these projects you will learn how to use some of basic tools, as well as some of the core parts in FRC and how they go together. The focus on this guide is primarily to familiarize yourself and build CAD skills within an FRC context. We'll try to explain how various parts throughout the process, but please use the discord if you have any questions!  

If you have a bit of prior experience with using Onshape's tools, you can skip the learning courses and polish your sketching and part design using a few CADvent drawings. Otherwise, please do the learning courses first; they help set a very good foundation for an efficient workflow.

## Onshape Courses

[Introduction to Sketching Course](https://learn.onshape.com/courses/introduction-to-sketching)<br>
[Part Design Course](https://learn.onshape.com/courses/fundamentals-part-design-using-part-studios)

These learning courses can help both old and new designers learn a good workflow for sketching and part design, and don't take that long to finish.

## CADvent Part Gallery
After completing the learning courses its still best to practice before moving further. Here are a variety of parts you can model to practice your sketching and modeling skills. 

To begin, make a copy of the [CADvent practice document](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/6af40b750516bfd9d86b2203/w/1a10c33aa547ad764e1c876c/e/d57a1b029a59e3fa8c410591). Each part you make will go into a separate part studio. Some have already been set up, but you may make more if you want to do more practice parts. Stop before the "Bonus: Gusset" part studio!

!!! tip
    Feel free to ask for help in the beginner channels in the DDS Discord Server.

We hope you enjoyed learning the basics of part design in Onshape.

It’s now time to build on this knowledge with a more fundamental understanding of the FRC design workflow.

## Multi-Part Modeling Theory

Now that you’ve modeled a single part and played around with sketches. We’ll be introducing a new concept. Multi-part part studios.

When designing in Onshape, you typically have 1 part studio for subassembly. We're not there yet, but the next couple of projects will slowly introduce you to this concept. 

Here is an example of one of the future projects that you’ll be working on. Notice how there are multiple parts inside of this one part studio, and how it “almost” looks like the completed product.

For now however, you can get a small glimpse of this concept in the "bonus" part studio. As you can see, two aluminum box tubes have already been modelled for you. A new sketch has been created on top of the tubes that is ready for you to create the part profile.

For this final 1A project, you will be challenged to design a part called a "gusset" that connects two tubes. This gusset will be created in the same part studio as the tubes that it is connecting! Here's an example of a gusset:

<center>![Example](\img\design-guide\stage1a\cadvents\8033-000-2024C_8.png){width=45% height=45%}</center>

Use the techniques you have learned to design this part in-context. This time you do not have a direct part drawing, so you'll have to reference the other parts in the part studio. Remember the Use tool: it's key here. Good luck!

!!! tip
    When extruding a sketch in a part studio, you can decide whether to "add" to existing geometry, or to create a "new" part. Make sure that when you extrude your gusset, you tell Onshape to create a new part.
