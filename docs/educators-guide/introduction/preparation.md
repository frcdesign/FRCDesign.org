# Preparation
Before using FRCDesign.org's Learning Course to teach your students, make sure you have an adequate understanding of the concepts covered. The best way to do this is to go through the course yourself; however, the level of involvement with which you do so is dependent on your previous knowledge. If you're new to Onshape, we recommend going pretty deep through the course as much as you can, at least so you're ahead of the students you're helping guide. If you're pretty experienced with Onshape and FRC Design, you might just go through the Educator's Guide and the Best Practices category to get a complete overview of the course and caught up to date with practices.

!!! Tip
    Check ChiefDelphi for any updates on the website's content and refresh yourself on the material every so often so you're up to date with information about the workflow and tools.

!!! Tip
    Sometimes school wifi can block the embeded youtube videos on the site. If this is the case all of the videos are available for download [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GUVB6ZssmJgS3k0waTas5IWN6-LMcRHH?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}.

## Onshape Classroom

Setting up an [Onshape Classroom](https://www.onshape.com/en/blog/educator-plan-first-robotics-teams "Onshape Classrooms for FRC"){:target="_blank"} is a great way to track student progress. Creating assignments for the various exercises also makes it easy to review the work students have done; this also useful in case you need to treat exercises as graded assignments.

## Final Advice

1. Remember that it is ok for students to be at wildly different sections of the course. 
2. Even if a student just gets through 1A, they would have enough knowledge to be somewhat helpful and easy to guide during build season. The more sections they complete, the more autonomous they should be as a designer, making them easier to lead to complete a task.
3. When helping students, make sure to not handhold them too much. If you're in a situation where you can get the student to solve a problem by asking some guiding questions, do that.
