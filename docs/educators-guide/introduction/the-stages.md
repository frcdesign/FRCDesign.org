# The Stages
The course progressively builds complexity while reinforcing core concepts of CAD organization, mechanism design, and engineering best practices. It starts with basic CAD skills and culminates in complete complex mechanism designs. 

## Stage Section Overview

Stage 0: Introduction to CAD

- Introduces CAD and its importance in FRC
