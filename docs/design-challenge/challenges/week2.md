# Design Challenge #2: Gearboxes

This week we will be designing a custom gearbox. Custom gearboxes can be used for many applications, from pivots for intakes or arms, to elevators, and much more. They are useful in certain applications due to their cheap cost and low backlash, as well as being highly customizable to different packaging situations. It is important for any well rounded designer to know their way around a custom gearbox.

=== "Beginner Challenge"

    Beginner Challenge:
    The year is 2019, and COTS swerve isn’t a thing yet (unless you want to run andymark swerve and steer…). Your team is designing a custom WCD, and needs gearboxes to drive it! 

    - Requirements:
        * Create a 2 stage gearbox with a total reduction of ~6:1
        * Gearbox must fit within the space requirements as outlined
        * Gearbox may use any motors of your choice, minimum of 2 maximum of 3

=== "Advanced Challenge"
    Advanced Challenge:
    Welcome back to Charged Up 2023! Some of you may be (too) familiar with this game, others may have never heard of it. It’s the end of week 1 and your team has just finished deciding a robot archetype: double jointed arm. It’s now your job to design that arm- without using COTS gearboxes. No planetaries, no wcp gearboxes, just your own skill to make a great double jointed arm.

    - Requirements:
        * Based on your team’s end effector design, the end of the arm (where a wrist might be) must be able to reach the 3 setpoints in the outline document.
        * The arm must stow within the frame perimeter, with at least 5 inches of clearance from the edge.
        * No electronics will be required, other than motors. 
        * Drivetrain details will not be looked at. 
        * No COTS gearboxes
        * Proper master sketch.

!!! question "Need Help?"
    If you are stuck, or have any questions, feel free to ask in the discord server! Same goes with getting your design looked over!

Good luck!
