# Design Challenge #5: Tilt Shift
The year is 2050. The internet was completely wiped 5 years ago, and all traces of past games have been completely destroyed. Your team has just built a time machine, and, following information about a legendary group of people collectively known as “F4”, have decided to go back in time to 2021 to see the wondrous games they’ve created. You stumbled across the game “Tilt Shift”, and decided to cad a subsystem for the game before deciding whether or not it is worth bringing back to the present. 

=== "Beginner"

    You’ve decided to create a manipulator for the game piece. Assume that you have some sort of way to move said manipulator from the scoring position to the loading position. A master sketch is *recommended* but not required.

=== "Advanced"
    Your goal is to create a master sketch for a full robot that can complete all aspects of the game. Additionally, pick one of those subsystems that *directly interacts with the game piece* and cad it.
