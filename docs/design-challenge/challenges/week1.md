# Design Challenge #1: Swerve Drivebase

Welcome to the first design challenge! We are going to start with a swerve drivebase, the foundation of your robot. We have two different levels of challenges, beginner and advanced. It is recommended to complete the beginner challenge first before going on to the advanced version. The advanced version is the same as the beginner challenge, with a few additional things added on.

=== "Beginner Challenge"

    * You need to choose a COTS swerve module
    * It needs to be assembled using 2" x 1" aluminum tubes
    * You need to add a bellypan
    * The drivebase needs to be legal to be used on the field. 

=== "Advanced Challenge"

    * Lay out and add mounting holes for all of the electronics, making sure to leave space for wires
    * Add in the electronics models and mate everything together
    * Add in and secure the battery in some way
    * Add bumpers 
    * Add bumper mounts
!!! question "Need Help?"
    If you are stuck, or have any questions, feel free to ask in the discord server! Same goes with getting your design looked over!

Feel free to check out drivebase examples [here](https://www.frcdesign.org/mechanism-examples/drivebase/ "Drive Base Mechanism Examples Page") if you need some brainstorming.

Good luck with your first challenge!
