# Design Challenges

Design Challenges are at the core of what makes DDS Special. Design Challenges provide a variety of different practice scenarios to iron your design skills and compete against others in a mutually beneficial way.

## Scoring
Each Design Challenge will net a total of 7 points maximum, with 4 for completion and 3 possible bonuses. **Late submissions** will allow participants to win up to 2 completion points and all 3 bonus points. 

### Bonuses
- Simplicity bonus: Awarded to submissions that simplify design to increase the quality of life of their team. 
- Quality bonus: Awarded to submissions that embody good CAD and design principles and reflect the time and effort put into making a design as clean as possible.
- Special bonus: Bonus point specific to each design challenge, usually involving the way the challenge is approached and the design is executed. 

### Leaderboards

Design challenges will feature two separate leaderboards: **Beginner** and **Intermediate/Advanced**. Each leaderboard will function independently, but points will be transferred when beginner members gain experience and self identify as intermediate. **Please correctly self identify with your skill level!** DDS is meant to be a community for learning, and trying to game the system by identifying as a beginner only discourages others. We operate on an honor system, but if someone is trying to game the system, we will punish them accordingly.
