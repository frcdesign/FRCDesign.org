# FRC Design Learning Course

Welcome to the design learning course, the main purpose and content of the website! Keep in mind that it's always a work in progress, so if you find any issues or have difficulty understanding something, please [give us feedback](https://forms.gle/dQ6w6RXJa6vSmcpw7 "Learning Course Feedback Form"){:target="_blank"}!

The purpose of the course is to take you from zero to being able to model a full robot. The content focuses on FRC-relevant features and tools, using engaging projects that not only introduce new CAD skills and practice old ones but also introduce engineering concepts. These projects gradually get less guided as you progress.

!!! Tip
    Despite how it looks, Onshape is quite different in its fundamentals from other CAD software. Start at [Stage 0A](stage0/0A/what-and-why-CAD.md "Stage 0A"){:target="_blank"} if you're switching from another CAD software or new to CAD and [Stage 1A](stage1/1A/introduction.md "Stage 1A"){:target="_blank"} if you already have some experience using Onshape. **You will struggle with later stages** if you don't have a solid grasp on the fundamentals of Onshape.

!!! Warning
    If you choose to skip to Stage 0, make sure to add [MKCAD](stage0/0B/MKCad.md "Adding MKCAD Tutorial Page"){:target="_blank"} and the [required featurescripts](stage0/0B/featurescripts.md "Stage 0 Featurescripts Page"){:target="_blank"} for the learning course.

!!! Warning
    Before starting, remember to take a look at the [website feature guide](../website-feature-guide.md "Website Feature Guide Page"){:target="_blank"} to gain an understanding of the different features used throughout the learning course!
