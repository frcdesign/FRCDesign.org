# Introduction to CAD
## Types of CAD
There are many different kinds of CAD, usually designed for specific industries in mind. The kind of CAD an architect might use would be different from the kind of CAD engineers use. The tools required may be different as well.

Engineers mostly use parametric feature-based CAD, which includes programs like Autodesk Inventor and Fusion, SolidWorks, and Onshape. These programs can be designed around different workflows, but usually have similar features. It's important to learn the workflow for a specific program; often, they aren't exactly transferrable.

## Other Engineering CAD Software

Although this guide uses Onshape, and the majority of FRC teams use Onshape due to its resources, teams may choose not to use it because of prior student and mentor experience and resources with another software, or a workflow has already been established that works very well for a team with a different software. Onshape is by no means common in the engineering industry, so mentors are more likely to be able to guide a team well using other softwares. Do note that it is very easy to learn Onshape if you have already used a different CAD software before. 

## Onshape
Depending on the circumstances, Onshape may not be the best fit for a team; however, this guide focuses on only Onshape. Much of the design process itself and many of the mechanism fundamentals and glossary still apply, no matter what CAD software you're using. If you choose to use a different software while going through the guide, be aware that the CAD workflow may be different and that you will have significantly less support.
