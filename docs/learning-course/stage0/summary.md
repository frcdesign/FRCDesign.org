# Stage 0 Summary

Congratulations on completing Stage 0! 

You've been introduced to the idea of CAD and why we use it in FRC, helped you set up an Onshape account with useful tools, and fundamentals about navigating Onshape.

You also learned the theory behind creating parts in feature-based CAD:

- Create a new sketch within a new part studio
- Define the sketch with constraints
- Transform the sketch into a 3D object with specified features
- Manipulate the part with additional features 
- Repeat these steps until the part is complete

Remember: One “part studio” can have multiple different parts. We won’t focus on it for now, but keep it in mind!

Now it's time to move on to Stage 1 where you'll start learning the software and doing exercises, practicing skills relevant to an FRC context. Good luck!
