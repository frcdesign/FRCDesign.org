## Setting up MKCad

MKCad is an Onshape plugin that contains a large library of parts that are often useful in FRC.

To install it, go to the [MKCad App](https://appstore.onshape.com/apps/Manufacturers%20Models/2ZT7X5D646R3LM3ZND7LGBTYRVM4SVH6CDDGM6I=/description "MKCad App Store Page"){:target="_blank"} in the Onshape Appstore.

Press "Subscribe", then "Get for Free". This will automatically add MKCad to your Onshape account.

!!! Note
    After subscribing, the MKCAD inserter won't show up in already open documents until you reload. This is a first-time thing though.
