# 2D: Cascade Elevator

## Project Overview

Because elevators are just mechanisms to move other mechanisms around, this project is similar to the dead axle pivot and will be designed without much context to learn the design process and components. You will get practice with designing elevators in the context of a robot in Stage 3.

To design the elevator, this document will be used as reference. After the engineering concepts section, you will follow a rough guide to model a copy of it.

### Engineering Concepts & Decisions

The engineering concepts and decisions made to design the reference elevator are covered in the following sections. We cover these concepts lightly so you can understand the principles enough to design one yourself. The design handbook covers the "why" for these concepts if you would like to gain a deeper understanding.
