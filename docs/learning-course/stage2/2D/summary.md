# 2D: Cascade Elevator

## Summary

You've completed Stage 2D! To summarize what you've learned in this stage:

- The concepts and key components of a cascade-rigged elevator
- The master sketch concepts and geometry for elevators
- Linear relations in assemblies
- The uses of tube plugs and crush blocks for tube assemblies
- More practice with a mechanism with moving parts and the origin cube

There's a lot of freedom for attaching mechanisms to this kind of elevator. If you mount it 90 degrees offset from the front of your robot, you can even create a passthrough mechanism that can move up and down. 

Once you practice more master sketch integration in the next stage, you will be able to replicate a robot with an angled elevator in the later part of Stage 3.
