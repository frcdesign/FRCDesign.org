# 2D: Slapdown Intake

## Over-the-Bumper Intakes
A common style of intake for gamepieces in FRC (depending on extension rules) is an "over-the-bumper" intake (OTB for short). These bring the gamepiece from the floor against and then over the bumper into another subsystem. They were used commonly in 2019, 2020, 2022, 2023, and 2024, and other past games. 

### Slapdown Intake

The two types of OTB intakes are "slapdown" which consists of a single set of arms with rollers which slap down and back up again, and four-bar linkages, which allow the intake to stow more horizontally instead of vertically. The intake designed in this stage will be a slapdown intake for 2022 (inspired by 4414 HighTide’s slapdown intake from 2023).

[Match footage of Team 1323's 2022 intake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSQX5c7G8yg "Team 1323 Match Footage"){:target="_blank"} is an example of a well executed slapdown intake.

Other mechanism examples and deep dives for OTB intakes can be found on the [slapdown intakes page](../../../mechanism-examples/intake/slapdown/index.md "Slapdown Intake Mechanism Examples Page"){:target="_blank"} and [4-bar intakes page](../../../mechanism-examples/intake/4bar/index.md "4-bar Intake Mechanism Examples Page"){:target="_blank"}. The mechanism fundamentals page is yet to be made but will also be a helpful resource.
