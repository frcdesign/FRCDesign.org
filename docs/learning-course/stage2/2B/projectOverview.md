# 2B: Basic Shooter

## Project Overview

You will be designing a flywheel shooter to launch a Power Cell, a 7 inch diameter foam ball, from the 2020/2021 Infinite Recharge game. Watch the [2020 Game Animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmiYWTmFRVE "2020 Game Animation Video"){:target="_blank"}, [Team 1690 2020 Robot Reveal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EPv0gfnSEw "1690 2020 Robot Reveal"){:target="_blank"} and [2021 Chezy Champs Finals 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBWlbf5j5SI "2021 Chezy CHamps Finals 2 Video"){:target="_blank"} for an understanding of the game tasks. Refer to the [game manual](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2020/Manual/2020FRCGameSeasonManual.pdf "2020 Game Manual PDF"){:target="_blank"} and [field layout drawings](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2020/PlayingField/LayoutandMarkingDiagram.pdf "2020 Field Layout Drawings"){:target="_blank"} for field elements and the [AndyMark website](https://www.andymark.com/products/7-in-diameter-foam-ball "Power Cell Product Page"){:target="_blank"} for power cell specifications.

The shooter will be designed to shoot the Power Cells into the high goal from just behind the white "Initiation Line."

### Engineering Concepts & Decisions

The following sections cover the basic shooter concepts, as well as the reasons for specific implementations in the example. We cover these concepts lightly so you can design your shooter and understand the basic ideas behind shooters. The design handbook covers the "why" if you would like to gain a deeper understanding.
