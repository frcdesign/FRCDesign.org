# 2B: Dead Axle Pivot

## Part Studio

1. Create a mate connector on the pivot point of the master sketch, owned by the origin cube. This will be used in the top level assembly to define motion between the subassemblies.
2. Create the cross bar tubes
3. Create the pivot support plates
4. Create the chain and hex axle using featurescripts
5. Create the dead axle tube, spacer, and washer.
6. Create the tubes for the arm, including access holes for bolts.
7. Create the plate to space the sprocket off from the arm.
8. Name and give materials and appearances to all your parts

!!! Note
    Try to create folders for related features while modeling the mechanism! It's easier doing it throughout the modeling process than saving all the clean-up for the end.
