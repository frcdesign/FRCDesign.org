# 2B: Dead Axle Pivot

## Summary

You've completed Stage 2B! To summarize what you've learned in this stage:

- Different types of axle usage
- Principles of designing a good pivot
- Applications of pivots (wrists, arms)
- One way of tensioning chain
- Different sources of backlash in a power transmission
- How to model a subsystem with multiple moving parts using the origin cube

This mechanism being completed leads to many more mechanisms that have multiple moving parts. Most robots have at least one pivot, though each one can be designed differently depending on the use case and packaging. 

Each pivot has some things in common though: try to minimize backlash, use a dead axle (usually with chain), and it will obviously need a power transmission included. 

In the next stage, you'll apply very similar concepts to an intake with a pivot and several rollers.
