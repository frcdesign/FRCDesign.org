# 2B: Dead Axle Pivot

## Power Transmission

Sprocket and chain is used for transmitting power due chain's high load rating and low chance of slipping. Using large sprockets bolted to the mechanism helps reduce backlash and increase load capacity, while ensuring that the axle remains a dead axle. 

Torque is transmitted directly to the rotating mechanism from the sprocket, while the entire thing only uses the axle as a structural member to rotate on.

### Reference Design
The reference design utilizes a 60T #25 chain sprocket to drive the arm.
