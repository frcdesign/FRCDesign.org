# 2C: Slapdown Intake

## Project

You will be designing a slapdown intake applicable to both the 2022 and 2023 games, both of which had a 9.5" diameter game piece.

To design the intake, this document will be used as reference. After the engineering concepts section, you will follow a rough guide to model a copy of it.

### Engineering Concepts & Decisions

The engineering concepts and decisions made to design the reference intake are covered in the following sections. We cover these concepts lightly so you can understand the principles enough to design one yourself. The design handbook covers the "why" for these concepts if you would like to gain a deeper understanding.
