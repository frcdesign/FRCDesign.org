# 2C: Slapdown Intake

## Intake Golden Rules

There are many good resources out there for how to design good intakes. Andrew Torrance from Team 254 has provided [a list of golden rules for roller intakes](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/besiktas-rsports-9483-2023-off-season-build-blog/440340/15 "Andrew Torrance's Golden Intake Rules Thread"){:target="_blank"}.

### The Rules

- The surface speed of intake rollers/wheels should be at least double the robot's max speed.
- Maximize grippiness with game piece through all methods to maximize energy transfer, and thus intake speed and reliability
- If object is squishy, make your rollers rigid, if the object is hard, make your rollers compliant/squishy. 
- Maximize intake area to make it easier to intake during auto and teleop. 
- Intakes need to be robust as they are frequently out of frame perimeter.
- Use sensors to detect game pieces. 

### Reference Design

The reference design follows all of the golden rules apart from sensor mounting as modeling 3D printed parts is outside the scope of this project.
