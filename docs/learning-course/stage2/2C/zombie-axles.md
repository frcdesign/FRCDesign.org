## Zombie Axles 

Since the arm pivot is a dead axle, the shaft doesn't spin with the arm. This means we can utilize the pivot shaft as a live axle to spin a pulley connected to the rollers. This is called a 'Zombie Axle', since the pivot shaft is being used as both a dead axle for the pivot and a live axle for roller power.

This design allows the roller motor to be located on the base of the robot, which reduces arm weight and protects the roller motor.

If you are having trouble visualizing this and have a 3d printer, you can print and assemble this 3D-printed model (Coming Soon).
