# 2C: Slapdown Intake

## Robustness

### Main Structure

The main structure uses 1/4" polycarbonate, 2x1 tubes, and nut strips to attach the plates directly to the frame. In this way, the structure would do an especially good job resisting impacts from the front. The rigid nature of the main plate mounting makes polycarbonate a good choice of material, which is lighter and stronger than pocketed aluminum. 

The two secondary plates used to make sure all axles are supported on two points aren't connected with a very rigid structure and so work better as aluminum.

### Intake Width

The intake is as wide as possible to decrease the precision and time needed by the driveteam or autonomous code to intake the game piece. The only aim is to get the game piece into the robot, then it can be centered or serialized inside frame perimeter, also minimizing the time that the intake is down.
