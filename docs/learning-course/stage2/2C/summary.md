# 2C: Slapdown Intake


## Summary

You've completed Stage 2C! To summarize what you've learned in this stage:

- Concepts behind designing an effective and robust intake
- Real application of a pivot
- Driving dead axle rollers
- "Zombie" Axles
- Intake master sketches and ball paths
- More practice with a mechanism with moving parts and the origin cube

Intakes like this one can be applied during a lot of years, but even if the mechanism type itself isn't used, many concepts, such as the pivot, zombie axle, and dead axle rollers can be reused for basically any mechanism moving or manipulating game pieces. 

In the next stage, you'll learn about a completely new mechanism with linear motion instead of rotation that can be used to extend part of your robot in a specific direction.
