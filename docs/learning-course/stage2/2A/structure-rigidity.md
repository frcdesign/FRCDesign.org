# 2A: Basic Shooter

## Rigidity

Rigidity is essential for every mechanism you design, and it is particularly critical for shooters to ensure consistent performance. If a shooter wobbles while driving or shooting, accuracy will be compromised, making it difficult to hit the target consistently.

### Reference Design

This shooter uses two 1/4" polycarbonate plates for the sides. The 1/4" thickness is chosen because polycarbonate is easy to machine, cost-effective, and rigid enough for shooters when properly supported. In the reference design, the plates are mounted to the bottom drive rails and reinforced with support beams. Standoffs, which also serve as a camera mount and ball guide, keep the plates spaced apart, ensuring the overall rigidity of the shooter.
