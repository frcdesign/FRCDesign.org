# New to Onshape

## Documents Page
Documents can be viewed and managed from the documents page. You can sort them with folders and labels. 

!!! Tip 
    Documents are somewhat analogous to "projects" in other CAD programs and contain multiple types of workspaces related to a project.

On the sidebar, you can switch between stuff owned by you and stuff owned by a classroom/team/organization, and a public search page which can be used to look through public Onshape files. 



!!! Tip
    The search page can help you find a ton of publicly available robot CAD from other teams to use as examples.

### Customizing Your Account
In the top right corner of the page, you can access the app store, learning center, and account settings. Feel free to adjust settings to your liking.

- Change default units and precision
- Change email notification preferences
- Change default view manipulation if you're more familiar with a different CAD software
- Use the subscriptions section to renew your student/educator subscription each year
- Change and add keybinds to specific actions

### Creating Documents
You can create a document or folder or import CAD files from your computer using the "Create" dropdown button on the left. You'll be able to see any copied documents from the learning course here whenever you want to return to them.

**Try creating a document!** Take a look at the different types of workspaces you can create within it and the tools available for each.
