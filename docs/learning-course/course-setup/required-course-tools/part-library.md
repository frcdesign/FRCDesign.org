## Setting up FRCDesignApp

FRCDesignApp is a plugin for Onshape that allows you to use a large library of parts that are useful when designing for FRC.

!!! Tip
    FRCDesignApp is the plugin/app that helps you insert components into your documents, while FRCDesignLib is the actual collection of components. FRCDesignApp may get upgraded to include more functionality in the future.

To install it, go to the [FRCDesignApp page](https://appstore.onshape.com/apps/Manufacturers%20Models/2ZT7X5D646R3LM3ZND7LGBTYRVM4SVH6CDDGM6I=/description "FRCDesignApp Store Page"){:target="_blank"} in the Onshape Appstore.

Press "Subscribe", then "Get for Free". This will automatically add the FRCDesignApp to your Onshape account.

!!! Note
    After subscribing, the FRCDesignLib inserter won't show up in already open documents until you reload. This is a first-time thing though.
