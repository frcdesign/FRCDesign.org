# 1A: Onshape Fundamentals

## Exercise #1: Simple Box Tube

For this exercise, you will be modeling a simple 2x1 with some holes in it. For this exercise, do not use any Featurescripts. 

### Box Tubes

In FRC, robot structures are typically constructed out of aluminum box tubing, similar to wood beams for a house. Aluminum box tubing is commonly found in 2"x1", 1"x1", and 2"x2" sizes with 1/8" (thickwall) or 1/16" (thinwall) wall thicknesses. Box tubing is typically referred to by its size, eg: 2x1, 1x1, and 2x2 (Spoken as "two-by-one", "one-by-one", and "two-by-two"). For the rest of the learning course, we will use this notation when referring to box tube.

      <figcaption>4. Add the top holes. Set the centerpoint of the hole to be vertical with the midpoint of the bottom line, then Mirror the hole across, using the front plane as the mirror line. We are able to use the front plane to mirror since we intelligently placed the origin at the center of the tube in step 1. </figcaption>

!!! Note
    Some sketches and features have been renamed (i.e. "Tube Profile"). You can rename sketches and features by hovering over the name in the dialogue box and clicking the pencil icon, or right clicking a sketch or feature in the feature list and clicking "rename". 

!!! success "Verification"
    If you did everything correctly your box tube should weigh about 0.35lbs




### Construction Geometry

Notice how we utilized construction geometry to define the location of the holes on the 2" face of the tube. Using construction geometry to assist with sketching makes your parts more parametric and betters conveys design intent compared to manually specifying the location of each hole with dimensions.
