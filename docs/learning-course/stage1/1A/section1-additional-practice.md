# Section 1 Sketch Practice

Time to pull everything together.

At this point, you should be comfortable sketching rectangles, dimensioning parts, mirroring, extruding individual tubes, and converting them to hollow box tubes.

This practice set will help you sharpen those skills.

## How to Practice

For each frame:

- Sketch the layout.
- Mirror wherever you can to minimize the number of dimensions needed.
- Fully constrain the sketch (no blue lines).
- Extrude each part separately (use Extrude Individual).
- Tube everything using the Tube Converter.

Stick your sketches to the Origin and Center Cube where it makes sense.

## Tips

!!! tip "Remember..."

    - Mirror lines save a lot of dimensions.
    - Think about construction lines when building symmetry.
    - Check that your frame matches the real-world shape before tubing.
    - Tubes should never overlap unless you have a reason.
    - Stay clean and organized — it’ll pay off later.
