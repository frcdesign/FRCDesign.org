## Tips

!!! tip "Remember..."

    - Mirror lines save a lot of dimensions.
    - Think about construction lines when building symmetry.
    - Check that your frame matches the real-world shape before tubing.
    - Tubes should never overlap unless you have a reason.
    - Stay clean and organized — it’ll pay off later.
