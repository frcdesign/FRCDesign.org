# Exercise 1: Rivets

Now that you know how to make parts, it’s time to start putting them together.

We’ll be starting assemblies by adding rivets to a simple gusset and tube fixture.

## Your Task

- Open the "Assemblies - Exercise 1 Rivets" tab.
- Insert a rivet from MKCAD into the Assembly.
- Use **Fastened Mate** to attach the rivet to the gusset.
- Use **Ctrl+C** and **Ctrl+V** to copy-paste more rivets.
- Fasten all the rivets to the gusset.
- Copy the gusset and place it on the back side, and add rivets there too.

## Notes

- Parts in assemblies can float around — you need to fasten them to fix them in place.
- Holding **Shift** while selecting can help you pick flat faces cleanly.
