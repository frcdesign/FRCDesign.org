# 1A: Onshape Fundamentals - Section 3

## Assembly Introduction

So far in 1A, you've been modeling custom parts in part studios. An assembly (a new type of tab) is where you **take those custom parts, assemble them together, and add buyable components like motors and fasteners**. 

While the part studio is used to plan and design individual components next to each other, the assembly is used to **create a 3D blueprint of all the parts involved and how they go together**.

!!! Warning
    As this is the first exercise where FRCDesignLib is being used, please be sure you have it added by following [the tutorial in course setup!](../../course-setup/required-course-tools/part-library.md "Adding FRCDesignApp Tutorial Page"){:target="_blank"} FRCDesignLib is a parts library for FRC used for inserting COTS components into assemblies.

## Exercise 1: Rivets

To get started, find the "S3 Exercise 1" assembly in the "Section 3" folder in your copy of the template document. 

1. Follow the video below to learn how to **insert a rivet** into your assembly **from FRCDesignLib** and **fasten** it to the gusset.

2. Repeat the process of fastening rivets until there is a rivet in all gusset holes.

3. When done with the first gusset, copy and paste it, fasten the copied part to one of the holes on the bottom (making sure the holes line up), and continue fastening rivets for that gusset.

    Holding **Shift** while selecting can help you pick flat faces.

When you're done fastening rivets to both gussets, move on to the next exercise.
