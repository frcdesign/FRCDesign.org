# 1A: Onshape Fundamentals

## Introduction
Welcome to Stage 1! Here, you'll engage in a series of Onshape exercises and projects designed to introduce and develop your CAD skills within an FRC context. 

!!! Tip
    Remember to take a look at the [website feature guide](../../../website-feature-guide.md "Website Feature Guide Page"){:target="_blank"} to gain an understanding of the different features used throughout the learning course!

### Split Screen
The learning courses and exercises work better if you can see both the instructions and the Onshape document at the same time. 

The recommended way of going through the course is using two screens, but if this isn't possible, utilize a split screen.
