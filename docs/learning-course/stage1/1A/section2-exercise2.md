# Exercise 2: Plates Gussets

In the last exercise, we just made a simple plate to get used to some of the tools we’ll be using. 
In section 1, we’ve been making drivetrains, but we need to connect them!

Let’s make a gusset for our drivetrain tube. This will allow us to connect tubes with fasteners in the future.

## Your Task

- Open the Plates Exercise 2 tab.
- Sketch the gusset shown below and extrude
- Mirror and make the same gusset for the other 3 corners of the DT

## Key Things to Watch For

!!! tip "Remember..."

    - Center your sketch on the origin.
    - Mirror across centerlines to avoid over-dimensioning.
    - Keep all sketches fully constrained (no blue lines).
    - Extrude plates to a consistent thickness.
    - Double-check that plates match across both sides of the frame.

Clean sketches will make later assembly much easier.
