# 1A: Onshape Fundamentals - Section 2
## Exercise 2: Gusset

In the last exercise, we made a single plate in isolation. In this exercise, you will create a plate that connects two box tubes together by combining tools learned previously with one new tool.

To get started, find the "Exercise 2: Gussets" part studio in the "Section 2" folder of the template document. 

Your task is **create a simple gusset for the provided drivetrain frame** by **repeating the workflow** you should have memorized in the previous exercise. The holes for this gusset will be copied into the sketch from the tubes of the frame with the `Use` tool:

Your final gusset should look like this:

!!! tip "Remember..."
    - The keybind for the `Use/Project` tool is the `U` key.
    - Arcs should only go on the corners of the gusset, not on every hole.

### Complete?
Try and **remake this gusset** (or a gusset of a different shape, maybe a T) for a **different section of the frame**!

When you're done with the **two gussets**, move on to the next exercise
