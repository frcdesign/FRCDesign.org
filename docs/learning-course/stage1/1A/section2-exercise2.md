# Exercise 2: Plates Gussets

In the last exercise, we made a single plate in isolation. Now lets use some of the tools we learned previously in combination with these new ones. In the past we made the tube layouts for drivetrains, now lets connect some of those tubes together.

Letâ€™s make a gusset for our drivetrain tubes. By making use of the "Use" tool you can easily copy holes from the drivetrain tubes to start your plate sketch. Heres a video showing how to use the "Use" tool:

## Your Task

Your task is to make use of the "Use" tool to draw a simple gusset for the provided drive frame. To get started find the "Exercise 2: Gussets" part studio in the "Section 2" folder of the template document. Simply repeat the steps you should have memorized in the previous exercise but with the holes of this new gusset. Your final gusset should look like this:

## Key Things to Watch For

!!! tip "Remember..."
    - The keybind for "Use" is the "U" key.
    - Arcs should only go on the corners of the gusset not on every hole.
