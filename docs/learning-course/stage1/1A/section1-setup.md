# 1A: Onshape Fundamentals

## Introduction and Setup

Welcome to Stage 1A! You'll be learning the basics of CAD throughout this stage. 


## Introduction to the Course
  This course is structured a bit differently from what you might be used to, and we hope you enjoy the process.
  In these exercises, we encourage you to experiment and figure out how a feature "works," You can usually move on once you are able to complete the exercises. Do note that the exercises build up on each other, so you are expected to do the content of the previous exercise in futher exercises. 


!!! warning

    Make sure the [required course tools](../../course-setup/required-course-tools/part-library.md) (the part library and featurescripts) are added to your Onshape account before starting this stage.


## Box Tube Intro

We will start off with Box Tubes, since they provide the primary structure of your robot. Box tubes are used in many places, from the drivetrain to the superstructure.
They are strong, lightweight, and easy to work with. You will have to make countless box tubes throughout your FRC career, so it's important to get comfortable with them.

### Example Usage

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 20px;">

From the side, a box tube can be represented as a simple rectangle.  
The most common dimensions are:

- **1 inch × 1 inch**

- **2 inch × 1 inch**

We'll be working with these increments throughout the stages, keep them in mind!
