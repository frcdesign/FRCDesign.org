# Introduction and Setup
Welcome to Stage 1A! You'll be learning the basics of CAD throughout this stage. 


!!! info "Advice"
    This course is structured a bit differently from what you might be used to, and we hope you enjoy the process.

    In these exercises, we encourage you to experiment and figure out how a feature "works," You can usually move on once you are able to complete the exercises. Do note that the exercises build up on each other, so you are expected to do the content of the previous exercise in futher exercises. 

## Box Tube Intro

The Box tubes are important since they provide the primary structure of your robot.

These are made out of aluminum, and typically are cut in 0.5 inch increments. You can think of them like legos.

## How are they used in real life?

From the side, a box tube can be represented as a simple rectangle.  
The most common dimensions are:

- **1 inch × 1 inch**

- **2 inch × 1 inch**

We'll be working with these increments throughout the stages, keep them in mind!
