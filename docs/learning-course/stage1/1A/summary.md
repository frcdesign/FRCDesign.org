# 1A: Onshape Fundamentals

## Summary

Congratulations on completing Stage 1A! Remember, practice is essential – the more CAD models you create, the more proficient and efficient you'll become. Using keyboard shortcuts can significantly accelerate your CAD workflow. Be attentive to best practices to avoid developing any bad habits. Keep up the good work!

Here is a quick summary of what you have achieved in 1A:

* Learned how to use the Onshape interface and basic sketching and modeling features with the Onshape Learning Center courses
* Learned how to model basic FRC structures
* Learned how to use the `Gusset`, `Extrude Individual`, `Tube Converter`, and `Spacer` Featurescripts
* Learned how to assemble basic models using `Group` and `Fasten`
* Learned about leveraging default geometry to enable easy symmetry with intelligently placed origins

In stage 1B, you will be introduced to power transmissions, which enable your robot to move and score.

## Check for Comprehension Questions for 1A

Before moving on to the next stage, take a moment to check your understanding of the key concepts from 1A. Try answering the following questions:

!!! note "Note"
    Feel free to refer back to the guide, but try your best to do these on your own.

1.  What is the primary advantage of using construction geometry in sketches?
    1.  It makes the sketch look more professional
    2.  It helps convey design intent and makes parts more parametric
    3.  It automatically creates dimensions
    4.  It reduces file size

2. Which Featurescript is used to create tubes with specified wall thickness and hole patterns?
    1. Extrude Individual
    2. Gusset
    3. Tube Converter
    4. Spacer

3. In a multi-part Part Studio, what extrude type should you select when creating a new part?
    1. Add
    2. Remove
    3. New
    4. Intersect

4. What is the purpose of the `Group` function in assemblies?
    1. To color-code parts
    2. To restrict relative motion between parts
    3. To hide parts from view
    4. To create a bill of materials

5. Short Answer: Describe the process of creating a gusset using the Gusset Featurescript.

6. What is the advantage of using the `Fasten` mate in an assembly compared to using `Fix`?
    1. It's faster to apply
    2. It allows for more degrees of freedom
    3. It's more parametric and maintains relationships between parts
    4. It automatically aligns parts

7. Short Answer: Explain why it's generally better to model all unique parts in a Part Studio, even if some parts are identical (like the vertical tubes in Exercise 3).

8. Short Answer: Describe two ways that using Featurescripts can improve your CAD workflow efficiency.
