# 1A: Onshape Fundamentals

## Sketching and Part Design
Sketches and features are the building blocks you will use to create every 3D model in Onshape, so it's good to have a good grasp on the fundamentals.

### Learning Center Courses

**Complete the following Onshape Learning Courses:**

1. The [**Introduction to Sketching**](https://learn.onshape.com/courses/fundamentals-sketching "Introduction to Sketching Onshape Learning Course"){:target="_blank"} course runs you through different sketch tools, constraints, and a good sketch workflow.

2. The [**Part Design Using Part Studios**](https://learn.onshape.com/courses/fundamentals-part-design-using-part-studios "Part Design Using Part Studios Onshape Learning Course"){:target="_blank"} course runs you through creating different parts with a variety of features.

With a good understanding of both of these, you can create almost any part you want to. The following sections are all about integrating design intent into the process and learning how to design a whole project with multiple pieces.


!!! Tip "Keyboard Shortcuts"
    Most sketch tools and feature tools have keyboard shortcuts available. Learning and using these can help speed up your workflow a ton. If you don't know the keyboard shortcut though and can't find the tool, use the shortcut `alt+c` to bring up the search bar and type the name of the tool you're looking for.

!!! Tip "Help Center Pages"
