# Section 2 Sketch Practice

Now that you've worked through some plate exercises, here's some extra practice.

The goal is to get even faster at sketching plates, fully constraining sketches, and extruding parts cleanly.

---

## Your Task

For each of the following frames:

- Sketch the plates needed.
- Mirror where possible.
- Fully constrain the sketches (no blue lines).
- Extrude to the correct plate thickness.

Focus on building clean, simple models.

## Practice Frames

<figure>

  <figcaption>Practice Frame 1 — add plates to match.</figcaption>
</figure>

  <figcaption>Practice Frame 2 — add gussets and plates where shown.</figcaption>

## Notes

!!! tip "Remember:"

    - Use mirror lines to save time when sketching.
    - Keep plate thicknesses consistent.
    - Double-check that all plates are fully constrained before extruding.
    - Center your sketches on the Origin when it makes sense.

Clean CAD practices now will save you a lot of pain later.
