# Exercise 6: Triangle Frame

Up until now, all our box tubes have been perpendicular.  
Sometimes, though, you’ll need frames that aren't at 90° angles — like triangles.

## Your Task

Using what you’ve learned:

- Sketch the triangle frame shown below.
- Extrude the shapes individually.
- Turn the solids into tubes with the Tube Converter.

You’ll need to find a way to **define angles** inside your sketch — either using distances or angles depending on what makes more sense.

## Tool Hint

There’s an **Angled Rectangle** tool hidden somewhere in Onshape.  
Try to find it!

You can also sketch normally and add dimensions and constraints manually if you prefer.

## Key Details

- Make sure your sketch stays fully constrained (black, no blue lines).
- Frame should still center around the origin like before.
- Insert the Origin Cube before sketching to keep your part properly grounded.

## Things to Watch Out For

!!! tip "Before moving on"

    - Are all tubes separate parts?
