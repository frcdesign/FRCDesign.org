# Exercise 6: Triangle Frame

All of our box tubes have been perpendicular to each other. Sometimes, you’ll have frames that are angled.

## Your Task

Using what you’ve learned:

- Try to copy the example triangle frame. Use the concepts you learned in the previous concepts to do so. **Remember to insert the origin cube first!** 
- Mess with the angled rectangle tool to make this work. Additional information and the sketch is shown below.

## Angled Rectangle

We can do this through the angled rectangle sketch tool. (Use alt+C or look in your rectangle menu) We do need to define the angle of the tube somehow, in which we can do either through distance or angle, depending on what we need.
