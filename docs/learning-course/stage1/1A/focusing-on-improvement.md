# Focusing on Improvement

When going through the exercises throughout Stage 1 and 2, an intentional focus on improving specific skills and speeding up your workflow can help accelerate your learning and make the exercises more effective. 

While some people will have a design lead or mentor to review their work and tell them what to improve on, **self-reviewing** can help you learn where you're making mistakes and what to focus on for improvement.

To **self-review** effectively, follow these steps:

1. Check your model **without using the reference solution** first to see if you missed anything or made any mistakes along the way (an offset is wrong, a wrong mate connector was used, you missed a part). 

2. Fix any mistakes you find until you feel that the model is perfect to the best of your ability. Figure out what you can do to help prevent those mistakes in the future.

3. Now compare your model and feature tree with the **reference in the provided Solutions Document** for the section. 

4. Look for any further mistakes with the model and fix them. Figure out why you missed those mistakes in your first self-review and what you can do to make sure they aren't missed in the next exercise.

5. Examine the best practices presented in the reference. Ask yourself what you need to improve on to improve the readability and parametricity of your CAD. This may include naming things, using folders, and using general recommended CAD practices [outlined here](../../../../best-practices/).

6. Ask yourself what the hardest and most time consuming part of the exercise was. Figure out what made it difficult or time-consuming and how to speed up your workflow. This may include your plate sketching, naming things, or finishing out assemblies.

7. Intentionally focus on everything you needed to improve on in the above steps during future exercises and projects. 

While self-reviewing can help people improve tremendously, don't forget that getting feedback from other people is still one of the best ways to learn what to improve on. You can implement both self-review and external feedback to maximize your intentionality while learning.
