## Exercise 2: Swerve Drive Assembly

Now that you've learned to use basic rivets, let's install them on a drivetrain.

To get started, find the "S3 Exercise 2" part studio in the "Section 3" folder in your copy of the template document.

**Follow the video below** to complete the exercise.

1. Copy, paste, and fasten the remaining gussets onto the drivetrain frame.
2. Insert rivets from MKCAD and fasten them to the gussets using the **Replicate** tool.
3. Insert **MK4N** drive modules (both **A** and **B** variants).
4. Attach the modules to the frame.

!!! Tip
    Try to make sure the modules are symmetrical across the right plane.

Once the gussets, rivets, and swerve modules are inserted, move on to the next exercise.
