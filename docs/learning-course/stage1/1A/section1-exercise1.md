## Exercise 1: Making Your First Tube

Let's start creating our first box tubes in Onshape. We'll be using the "extrude" tool in order to do this.

## Watch the Walkthrough

Follow along with the video to extrude your first box tubes:

!!! info "As you work through the exercise, notice how:"

    - Changing the extruded length affects the box tube.
    - The dimensions of the sketch translate directly into the dimensions of the tube.

## Tube Converter Settings

When using the Tube Converter (as shown in the video), make sure your settings match:

</figure>

If the Tube Converter isn't behaving as expected:
- Only select the rectangles that are not touching, as shown in the video.
- You can remove a selection by clicking the "x" next to the part in the Tube Converter menu.

If you forget the name of a tool, you can press **Alt+C** to search for it.

## Done following along? 

Mess around with the tubes a bit more, try extruding different lengths, using different extrude offsets and settings, and play to see how they relate to your final box tube.

After 5 minutes or so, move on.
