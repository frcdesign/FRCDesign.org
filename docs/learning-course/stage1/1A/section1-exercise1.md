As you work through the exercise, notice how:

- The dimensions of the sketch translate directly into the dimensions of the tube.

If the Tube Converter isn't behaving as expected:
- Only select the rectangles that are not touching, as shown in the video.
- You can remove a selection by clicking the "x" next to the part in the Tube Converter menu.

If you forget the name of a tool, you can press **Alt+C** to search for it.
