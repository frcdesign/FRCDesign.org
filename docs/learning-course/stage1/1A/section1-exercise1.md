## Exercise 1: Making Your First Tube

Let's start creating our first box tubes in Onshape. We'll be using the "extrude" tool in order to do this. 

You'll be:

1. Following along with the video to learn how we can make box tubes in onshape
2. Playing with the tools you learned to explore how the concepts work
3. Understanding how these parts interact in 3D Space

## Watch the Walkthrough

Follow along with the video to extrude your first box tubes:

!!! info "As you work through the exercise, notice how:"

    - Changing the extruded length affects the box tube.
    - The dimensions of the sketch translate directly into the dimensions of the tube.

## What do I need to keep in mind about the extrude tool?

!!! info "New vs Add"
    
    If if you extrude a tube next to another tube, you might notice that they merge together. Make sure to use the "new" option in your extrude menu, since sometimes onshape will default to "add" (add gif here)

!!! info "Symmetric vs Blind
    
    Depending on what you want to do 

!!! info "Up to Face"

## Tube Converter Settings

When using the Tube Converter (as shown in the video), make sure your settings match:

<figure>

  <figcaption>Tube Converter settings example.</figcaption>
</figure>

If the Tube Converter isn't behaving as expected:
- Only select the rectangles that are not touching, as shown in the video.
- You can remove a selection by clicking the "x" next to the part in the Tube Converter menu.

If you forget the name of a tool, you can press **Alt+C** to search for it.

## Done following along? 

Mess around with the tubes a bit more, try extruding different lengths, using different extrude offsets and settings, and play to see how they relate to your final box tube.

After 5 minutes or so, move on.
