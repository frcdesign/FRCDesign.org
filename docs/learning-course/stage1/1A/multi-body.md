# 1A: Onshape Fundamentals


## Multi-Part Modeling

Onshape is a software focused on a *top-down design* workflow using multi-part part studios. It allows you to create several different related parts in the same tab, all referencing each other, making the part creation for something like a subsystem easy.

### Learning Center Course
**Complete the following Onshape Learning Course:**

- The [**Multi-Part Part Studios**](https://learn.onshape.com/courses/fundamentals-multi-part-part-studios "Multi-Part Part Studios Onshape Learning Course"){:target="_blank"} course runs you through top-down design principles, sketching for multiple parts (layout sketches), and some more practical skills for working with multiple parts in a part studio.

Check out [this page](../../../best-practices/sub-document-setup.md "Sub-Document Best Practices Page"){:target="_blank"} to learn more about best practices for sub-documents. The following practice exercises will reinforce these concepts.

!!! Example "Multi-Part Part Studio Example"
    Notice how there's only one instance of each unique part within this part studio. The part studio resembles the completed product, as the parts are modeled relative to each other.
