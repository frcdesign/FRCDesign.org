# 1A: Onshape Fundamentals


## Multi-Part Modeling

Onshape is a software focused on a *top-down design* workflow using multi-part part studios. It allows you to create several different related parts in the same tab, all referencing each other, making the part creation for something like a subsystem easy.

!!! Example "Multi-Part Part Studio Example"
    Notice how there's one instance of each unique part within this part studio. The part studio also resembles the completed product, as the parts are modeled relative to each other.
