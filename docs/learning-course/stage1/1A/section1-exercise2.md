# Exercise 2: Adding Cross Rails

## Intro

Drivetrains are pretty important â€” they let the robot move. 
They're usually built out of box tube and have to be strong enough to survive to not explode when running into things. 

Check out the video below to see a drivetrain in action. Spot where box tube is used.

## Your Task

Let's add some cross rails to support the drivetrain better. Use what you learned in the previous exercise to try to figure it out. Good luck!

<div style="display: flex; gap: 5px; align-items: flex-start;">
  <figure style="flex: 1;">
    <img src="/img/learning-course/stage1a/dt-top.webp" style="width:90%">
    <figcaption>Missing Cross Rails</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <figure style="flex: 1;">
    <img src="/img/learning-course/stage1a/drivetrain-example.webp" style="width:90%">
    <figcaption>Complete Drivetrain</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>


Think about this while you work:  
**Which extrude setting makes sure the cross rails end up in the right spot?**

After you get the cross beams:

- Turn the blocks into tubes using the Tube Converter.

## Quick Part Studio Check

  <figcaption>Make sure your parts don't overlap!</figcaption>
</figure>

Your Part Studio should match what you'd build in real life. If it overlaps like this, how do you fix it? 

Always check that your CAD makes sense physically.

## Make It Look Nicer

Once your two tubes are set, let's change the appearance so it looks better. Follow the video below.
