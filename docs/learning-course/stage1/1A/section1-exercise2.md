# Exercise 2: Adding Cross Rails

Drivetrains are pretty important — they let the robot move. 
They're usually built out of box tube and have to be strong enough to survive to not explode when running into things. 

Check out the video below to see a drivetrain in action. Spot where box tube is used.

## Your Task

Let's add some cross rails to support the drivetrain better.

- Open up Exercise 2 in Onshape.
- "Extrude" the two empty rectangles to create the cross beams.
- Make sure you're doing a **new** extrude feature, and extrude the rectangles **up to** the far side.
- If you click the wrong thing, you can deselect it by hitting the "x" in the extrude menu.

Think about this while you work:  
**Which extrude setting makes sure the cross rails end up in the right spot?**

After you get the cross beams:

- Turn the blocks into tubes using the Tube Converter.

## Quick Part Studio Check

Your Part Studio should match what you'd build in real life.  
If you forgot to use **Symmetric** during the extrude, your bracket might be shoved inside the existing tube — which obviously wouldn't work on an actual robot.

Always check that your CAD makes sense physically.

## Make It Look Nicer

Once your two tubes are set:

- Right-click the parts.
- Change their **appearance** (color them) to make things cleaner.

If you forgot how to do it:

Keeping your CAD clean — naming sketches, sorting features into folders, naming parts, coloring stuff —  
makes it way easier for someone else (or future you) to understand what’s going on.

## Note

The Cube and the Dot show where the floor and center of the robot are.  
Ask yourself:  
**If you built this robot in real life, would your parts actually be where they need to be?**
