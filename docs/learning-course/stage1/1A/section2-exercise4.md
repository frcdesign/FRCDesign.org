# 1A: Onshape Fundamentals - Section 2
## Exercise 4: Motor Mounting Plate 

In this exercise, you will be making a simple motor mounting plate. It shouldn't be too difficult, since it is similar to the gussets and plates made in the previous exercises.

To get started, find the "Exercise 4: Motor Mounting" part studio in the "Section 2" folder in your copy of the template document. 

**Using the reference image and dimensions** listed below, sketch out and extrude the motor mounting plate:

- Create a 2.5" circle made out of construction geometry to represent the motor. 
- The cutout at the center of the plate is 1.25", and all the other holes are 0.196" diameter (the clearance fit for #10-32, the standard bolt size for most FRC components). 
- Try to use the `Circular Pattern` tool to make the holes for the motor in a 2" diameter circle, with a circle cut out for the middle of the motor. 
- The top arc of the plate should be coincident with the motor outline. Dimension the motor outline from the box tube to ensure there's clearance for it.

### Complete?
Go back to your Section 2 Exercise 3 part studio and try and add a motor mount to the to somewhere on the superstructure.

Move on to the next exercise in Section 3 when you're done with the motor mounting plate.
