# Exercise 4: Motor Mounting Plates 

In this exercise you will be making a simple motor mounting plate. This should not be too difficult since it will be similar to the gussets you have made in the previous exercise.


## Your Task

To get started find the "Exercise 4: Motor Mounting" part studio in the "Section 2" folder of the template document. 

Sketch out the motor mounting plate using the reference image below. Make sure to use the "Circular Pattern" tool to make the holes for the motor.
