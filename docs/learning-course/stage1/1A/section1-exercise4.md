## Building the Frame

Now that you’ve sketched individual parts, it's time to create a full drivetrain frame.

Your goal is to sketch and extrude the rectangles shown below, then tube them using the Tube Converter.

Make sure to **mirror your sketches** using construction lines — don't manually draw both sides.

## Important Notes

!!! warning "Common mistakes to avoid"

    - Make sure to mirror across both X and Y axes.
    - Avoid overdimensioning your sketches — use symmetry whenever possible.
    - Make sure the cross beams are also mirrored properly.
    - Use the origin as the center reference point for everything.

If your sketch is fully constrained (everything turns black), you’re doing it right!

## Extruding the Frame

Once your sketch is complete, extrude and tube convert into your drivetrain, like usual.


## After

- Add your cross rails from the last exercise, then it is complete.


## Checking Your Frame

- Double-check that no parts are fused together incorrectly.
- Use the cube and dot (origin and ground) to verify alignment.
- Make sure tubes line up properly with the module placements.
