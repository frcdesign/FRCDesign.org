# Exercise 5: Adding Fasteners and Gussets to a Full Frame

In section 2, your last exercise involved a full superstructure with a bunch of plates and gussets. Insert that part studio, assemble it, and measure and add all of the fasteners that you feel like you need.

The goal here is just to get practice and put everything you learned together.

!!! tip

    - A good rule of thumb is to have 1 bolt and have the rest of the holes be rivets
    - CTR + C and CTR + V is your friend

Good luck!
