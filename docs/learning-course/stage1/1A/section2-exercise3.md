# 1A: Onshape Fundamentals - Section 2
## Exercise 3: Superstructure Gussets

In this exercise you will be using all of the skills you have learned so far, and also learning how to use the `Linear Pattern` and `Mirror` features to save time when modeling repeat geometry.

To get started, find the "Exercise 3: Gusset Practice" part studio in the "Section 2" folder in your copy of the template document. 

**Create the three types of frame gussets** that will be holding this structure together. You can **use the reference image** below to get an idea of what these should look like.

After you have the three gussets modeled, **move on to the main side plate**. Try to make use of the `Linear Pattern` and `Mirror` features to make the repeating holes around the top and sides of the side plate.

!!! tip "Remember..."
    - For the gussets and plate, copy at most 1 hole per tube from with the `Use` tool - use `linear pattern` for the rest.
    - Use the `mirror` tool to make the right or left side of the mounting holes instead of making a third `linear pattern`.

When you're done with the gussets and large side plate, move on to the next exercise.
