# Exercise 3: Superstructure Gussets

In this exercise you will be using all of the skills you have learned so far, and also learning how to use the "Linear Pattern" and "Mirror" features to save time when modeling repeat geometry.

## Your Task

To get started find the "Exercise 3: Gusset Practice" part studio in the "Section 2" folder of the template document. 

The first thing you want to do is create the frame gussets that will be holding this structure together. You can use the reference image below to get an idea of what these should look like.

After you have all of the gussets modeled you can move on to the main side plate. You should make use of a "Linear Pattern" and "Mirror" features to make the repeating holes around the top and sides of the side plate.

To learn how to use these features watch this video:

(David pls make video thx)

Your plate should:
- Copy at most 1 hole per tube from the "Use" tool
- Use the mirror tool to make the right or left side of mounting holes, instead of making a third linear pattern.
