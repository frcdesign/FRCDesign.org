1. Insert your Section 3 Exercise 3 Part Studio (with the single gusset).
2. Group all frame components.
3. Insert the MK4i if you haven't already.
4. Fasten the modules to the corners of the frame.
5. Insert bolts using FRCDesignLib (10-32x2.5" Socket Head Cap Screws).
6. Measure the distance between faces to determine the bolt length, rounding up to the nearest size. 
7. Fasten the bolts properly.
8. Use the `Replicate` tool (set to `match edges on a plane`) to duplicate bolts across the modules.
