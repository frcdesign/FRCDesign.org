4. Fasten the modules to the corners of the frame.
5. Insert bolts using the Standard Content Library (Socket Head Cap Screws).
6. Measure the distance between faces to determine the bolt length, rounding up to the nearest size. 
7. Fasten the bolts properly.
8. Use the `Replicate` tool (set to `match edges on a plane`) to duplicate bolts across the modules.
