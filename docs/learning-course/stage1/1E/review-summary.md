# Review & Summary

## Review

Make sure to review all the CAD you've done using [the review instruction page](../1A/focusing-on-improvement.md "Focusing on Improvement Page"){:target="_blank"}. If you copied the reference through the instruction slides, you can check against the solution document; otherwise, just exclude that step from the review.

## Summary

Congratulations on completing Stage 1E! With the Stage 1E tasks completed, your drivebase is now fully functional and could even be used as a blueprint to manufacture and assemble one.

Here is a quick summary of what you have achieved in 1E:

* Practiced adding parts within the context of a robot, making sure to use an intelligent origin
* Learned the typical workflow for detailing a complex subsystem
* Learned about battery mounting and the importance of a secure battery holder
* Learned about core FRC electronics and how and where to mount them
* Learned how to use the `Electronic Mounting` Featurescript
* Optionally learned how to pocket a bellypan
* Learned about bumpers, how to model them, and the importance of having a secure mounting system

In Stage 2, you will begin to model robot mechanisms using all the skills you have learned and practiced in Stage 0 and Stage 1. This will teach mechanism design, the purpose and correct usage of some COTS parts, and many important engineering concepts.
