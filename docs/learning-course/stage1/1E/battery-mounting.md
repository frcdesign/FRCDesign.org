## Battery Mounting
Ensuring that your robot’s battery does not fall out of your robot is critical for successful robot operation. While it may seem obvious, even veteran teams [sometimes](https://youtu.be/bhjb3Vw8YHg?si=Bxm7oD5VkmYW7oj0&t=105 "3647 Battery Falling Out"){:target="_blank"} get [this](https://youtu.be/Dr_rnN2bjno?si=roWawTsyWt5W3RdA&t=86 "3647 Battery Falling Out...Again"){:target="_blank"} wrong. 
Successful battery mounting can be broken down into two components: good battery placement and a robust battery holder.

### Battery Placement
Batteries are heavy: the FRC robot battery weighs a whopping 13 lbs. Since the battery is so heavy, you need to place it as low as possible to keep your robot’s center of gravity low to prevent tipping over. Most teams will typically use the bellypan to support their battery as this is the lowest location on the robot. 

### Battery Holder

A strong strap is needed to secure the battery to its mount, preventing it from dislodging during hard collisions. A good option is to use a 1” or 2” wide buckle strap, which can be purchased and cut to size from most stores. FRC vendors like WCP also sell [battery mounting accessories](https://wcproducts.com/products/batteries-accessories "WCP Battery Accessories Product Page"){:target="_blank"} including battery holders and straps.
