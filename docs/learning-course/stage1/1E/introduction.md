# 1E: Subsystem Workflow - Detailing the Drivebase

## Introduction

In the previous sections, you've learned the fundamentals of modeling parts and power transmissions and learned the top-down design workflow. 
In Stage 1E, you will practice those modeling techniques by **adding the rest of the necessary components to the drivebase you began modeling in Stage 1D**. 
This will help you get comfortable with the typical workflow of a modeling an entire subsystem while keeping things simple.

### Subsystem Workflow
The typical workflow when modeling a subsystem involves the following:

1. Create the layout sketches in your layout sketch part studio
2. Derive the layout sketch into the part studio
3. Create the basic structure of your mechanism based on the layout sketch (plates, tubes, etc.)
4. Insert the basic structure into the assembly, group, fasten to the origin, and finish creating the structure
5. Insert the assembly into the top-level robot assembly
6. Go back and add different components to finish detailing the subsystem.
