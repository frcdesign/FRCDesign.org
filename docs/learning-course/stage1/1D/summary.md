# 1D: Design Methodology - Simple Swerve Drivebase

## Summary

Congratulations on completing Stage 1D! Keep up the good work!

Here is a quick summary of what you have achieved in 1D:

* Learned about top-down robot design methodology and master sketches
* Learned how to use the derive feature to drive part studios using master sketches
* Learned how to use the origin cube to mate together top level assemblies
* Learned how to model a simple swerve drivetrain

In Stage 1E, you will continue to detail the swerve drivebase you just created and practice the workflow for adding components to a subsystem with an intelligent origin.
