# 1D: Design Methodology - Simple Swerve Drivebase

## Drivetrain Master Sketches
To begin, you will be creating a layout sketch of the drivetrain. This will dictate the size and position of the drive tubes. The layout will be drawn from the side and top view of the drivetrain. For your swerve drivebase, you will make it 26"x26".

### Instructions

Start by **creating a new Onshape Document called `Stage 1D Robot`** and within it, **a new part studio called `Master Sketch`**. Then, use the `Origin Cube` Featurescript to create an origin cube. **Follow the instructions in the slides** to complete the master sketch.

      <figcaption>4. Create the top layout sketch by using the bottom mate connector on the vertical line of the side layout. Utilizing auto-generated mate connectors for sketch planes is a very useful tool to have. Press the “Top” button on the view cube to get a top view.</figcaption>

      <figcaption>5. Sketch the top outline of the drive base. Make the rectangle a square and set the side length equal to the length of the side layout tube. This ensures that the size of the top layout always matches the side layout, which makes the design parametric. Notice that the sketch is fully defined despite having no sketch dimensions.</figcaption>

      <figcaption>8. To apply the cutout for all four tubes, we use the <code>Circular Pattern</code> sketch tool to copy the lines to all four corners. For a  <code>Circular Pattern</code> we first define the number of instances and then the axis of rotation.</figcaption>

As previously explained, this method of top-down modeling is extremely powerful as it enables you to capture the most important dimensions all in one place. However, you should be careful to not over-detail master sketches. You will be practicing master sketches all throughout Stage 2, and use them in Stage 3 alongside multi-document practices to design a whole robot.
