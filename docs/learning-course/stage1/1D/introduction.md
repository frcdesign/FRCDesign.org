# 1D: Design Methodology - Simple Swerve Drivebase

## Introduction

So far, you've worked on CAD fundamentals through courses and FRC-relevant exercises, but haven't done anything within a larger context. In this stage, you'll dive right into designing for a real robot. In this project, you will be designing a swerve drivebase while being introduced to a design workflow that will be applied to all future projects. 

1. Learn the basics of top-down design and mastersketching
2. Model a swerve drivebase using COTS swerve modules
3. Create a top-level assembly and insert a pre-modeled mechanism (1678's 2023 elevator and manipulator) 

Even if you've already CADed a drivetrain the past, this guide serves as an excellent introduction to the **top-down master sketch** design methodology.
