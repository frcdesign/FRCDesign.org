# 1C: Practice Mechanisms

## Exercise 3: Ball Shooter

Starting with exercise 3, the instruction slides will only provide part-by-part instructions and key details. 
For exact feature details, you should refer to the exercise solutions document. 
This is to prepare you for later exercises that are gradually less guided.

In this exercise, you will be modeling a very simple 2.5" ball shooter. 
This mechanism features 3D printed pulleys, a 3D printed ramp, and nut strips. Be sure to pay attention to layout sketches when modeling. 

### 3D Printed Pulleys
Thus far, you've only utilized COTS pulleys in your assemblies. 
However, 3D printed pulleys are a fantastic alternative since they are cheaper, readily available (assuming you have a 3D printer), and highly customizable.
<!-- Most applications that utilize pulleys (rollers, shooter wheels, etc) are low torque so 3D printed pulleys provide more than adequate strength. -->

3D printed pulleys can easily be generated using pulley generators, such as the one included in MKCad.
Close attention must be paid to the shaft interface however. 3D printed hex profiles can easily strip out, so a metal insert (Available from vendors like [WCP](https://wcproducts.com/products/adapters "WCP Adapater Product Page"){:target="_blank"} or [Thrifty Bot](https://www.thethriftybot.com/products/qty-5-aluminum-insert-for-3d-printed-parts "Thrifty Bot 3D Print Adapter Product Page"){:target="_blank"}) should be used to better transfer torque.
Take a look below at some examples of 3D printed pulleys with different types of inserts.

### Nut Strips
Nut strips are a very versatile structural component often used to connect perpendicular plates or a plate to a tube.
Vendors like [WCP](https://wcproducts.com/products/nut-strips){:target="_blank"}, [REV](https://www.revrobotics.com/3-8in-nut-strips/ "REV Nut Strips Product Page"){:target="_blank"}, and [Last Anvil](https://lastanvil.com/products/nut-strip){:target="_blank"} carry nut strips in 6" long segments with either #10-32 or #8-32 tapped holes.
These nut strips are very robust and can be easily cut to any length.
In the exercise you just completed, the nut strips would allow you to easily mount the shooter onto any surface.

!!! note "Verification"
    If all is done correctly your assembly should have 44 Instances.

### Isolate, Hide, and Make Transparent

The Isolate tool hides all other parts except the selected ones, helping focus on specific components. 
The Hide tool removes the selected parts from view, while Make transparent allows you to see through the selected parts without removing it, useful for accessing obscured components. 

Rather than deleting or moving parts, you should use these tools to access the parts you need for your task. If you hide parts, don't forget to un-hide them for the next person!

!!! Tip "Keyboard Shortcuts"
    Just like most other tools and constraints in Onshape, hide/show has a nice keyboard shorctut combination. Hover over a part with your cursor or select it and press `y` to hide it. Hover over the same space and press `shift+y` to unhide the part.
