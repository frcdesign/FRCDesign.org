# 1C: Design Methodology - Simple Swerve Drivebase

## Summary

Congratulations on completing Stage 1C! Keep up the good work!

Here is a quick summary of what you have achieved in 1C:

* Learned about top-down robot design methodology and master sketches
* Learned how to use the derive feature to drive part studios using master sketches
* Learned how to use the origin cube to mate together top level assemblies
* Learned how to model a simple swerve drivetrain

Remember, practice is essential – the more CAD models you create, the more proficient and efficient you'll become. Using keyboard shortcuts can significantly accelerate your CAD workflow. Be attentive to best practices to avoid developing any bad habits.

In Stage 2, you will begin to model robot mechanisms using all the skills you have learned in Stage 0 and Stage 1! Note that in stage 2, the learning course will become less step-by-step and more open ended, which will enable you to add your own input on designs based on your team's way of doing things. As always though, reference CAD models will be available.
