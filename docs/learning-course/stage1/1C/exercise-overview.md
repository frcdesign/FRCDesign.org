# 1C: Practice Mechanisms
## Exercise Overview

**Make a copy of the Stage 1C Exercises Document** through the button below. Each exercise has a folder, a "reference" tab (a preview of what the final model should look like), and a tab or two for doing your exercise in. Solutions are also provided in the 1C Exercise Solutions Document to check your work afterwards. You **do not** need to make a copy of the solutions document.

Each exercise should take no more than 40 to 45 minutes to complete.

As you progress through the exercises, the level of guidance will gradually decrease. This is to help transition you from more guided exercises to projects that have little more than the parts to be added and the reference model, as will be the norm for the rest of Stages 1 and 2. While you should reference the solutions document to ensure your model and modeling methods are correct, try to avoid *blindly* copying the model later in the exercises.

!!! Note "Primary Goal"
    The primary goal of this stage is to get you enough practice with CAD and modeling in the context of FRC where you won't need guidance in every step that you do. If you find that you struggle without guidance on the later exercises, feel free to try and model more small mechanisms of your choice, making sure to get feedback on them from [the Discord Server](https://discord.gg/jHXTdNjYCg "David's Design Server Invite"){:target="_blank"} or your team.

Focus on refining your CAD techniques and following best practices such as fully constraining your sketches, modeling in a way that captures design intent, and naming your features and parts.
