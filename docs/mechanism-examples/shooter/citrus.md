## Behind the Design

Hooded ball shooters all follow the same fundamental design principles, in an effort to produce the most consistent and accurate shots possible. These can be broken down to the following ideas: 

- Maximize contact time with the game piece you are shooting. This benefits shot consistency as it gives the gamepiece more time to match the speed of the flywheels. 
- Ensure your shooter can aim with adequate precision.
- Ensure your flywheels have enough mass to hold a consistent speed throughout the shot.
- *In some cases,* spin can be beneficial.

|<figure>![1678 Backrollers](../../img/mechanism-examples/shooter/1678-shooter/1678backrollers.webp){height=90% width=90%}|<span style="font-size:0.75rem;"> Hooded shooters in 2022 featured backrollers for one main purpose: Controlling backspin. A unique aspect of the 2022 game was the high goal that robots were required to shoot into. The geometry of the goal led many teams to find that their shots bounced out with high backspin. As a remedy, teams added backrollers to their shooters that were geared to spin in the opposite direction as the main flywheel. This reduced backspin on the balls to a manageable amount, but in some cases left just a little bit. This is due to the aerodynamics of spinning balls; thanks to the [Magnus effect](https://youtu.be/T9xsTO6ujqM?feature=shared&t=594 "Magnus Effect Video"){:target="_blank"}, backspin on rapid react balls helped them arc better into the high goal, and increased their stability in flight for long distance shots.</span>|

|<span style="font-size:0.75rem;">Hooded shooter flywheels typically use [TTB Urethane Wheels](https://www.thethriftybot.com/products/4-solid-urethane-wheel-1-2-hex-bore-45a-durometer?_pos=8&_sid=e09924749&_ss=r "TTB Urethane Wheel Product page"){:target="_blank"} or [Stealth Wheels](https://www.andymark.com/products/stealth-wheels-options "Steal Wheel Product page"){:target="_blank"}. It is important that your flywheels maintain enough mass to hold a constant speed throughout the shot, to ensure consistent shots. Increasing the mass of your flywheel will increase it's [moment of inertia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHQOctEvtTY "Moment of Inertia VideO"){:target="_blank"}, which in turn will increase its consistency. Games in which you can hold and shoot multiple pieces at a time such as Rapid React and [Infinite Recharge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmiYWTmFRVE "Infinite Recharge Game Reveal Video"){:target="_blank"} especially necessitate massed flywheels. The 1678 shooter in 2022 utilized two SDS flywheels for its mass. </span> |<figure>![1678 Flywheel](../../img/mechanism-examples/shooter/1678-shooter/1678%20flywheel.webp){height=90% width=90%}|

|<figure>![1678 Pivot](../../img/mechanism-examples/shooter/1678-shooter/1678pivot.webp){height=60% width=60%}| <span style="font-size:0.75rem;">The most common method of pivoting a hooded shooter is a rack and pinion. 1678 utilized a 3DP rack integrated with their shooter's "hood," and a smaller gear that "climbed" the hood gear. This simple design allows for precise actuation of the hood to a wide range of angles.</span>|
