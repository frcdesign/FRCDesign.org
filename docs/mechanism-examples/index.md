# Mechanism Examples

"Steal from the best, invent the rest" - Mike Corsetto, Head Coach of Team 1678. Don't ever be afraid of taking inspiration from designs of other robots. This page acts as a design reference and learning page for a wide variety of mechanisms.

!!! Note

    A CAD link has been provided when available, but examples without CAD can still be useful to look at with Behind The Bumpers videos and ChiefDelphi threads.

!!! Abstract "Contribution"

    This library of mechanism examples always needs expansion. Follow the [contribution guidelines](../contribution/methodsOfContributing.md "Methods of Contributing Page") to add your own examples or help write Behind the Design pages for existing examples.
