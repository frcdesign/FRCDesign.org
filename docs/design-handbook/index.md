# Design Handbook
These sections form an extensive and in depth reference manual that covers both fundamentals and advanced techniques in FRC robot design. While examples are given in Onshape, the content is largely CAD software agnostic.

Keep in mind that this category is a large work in progress, and will continue to be added to long after the design guide is finished. Feel free to write your own content for something we don't have yet and we'll try to incorporate it into the website (See [contribution guide](../contribution/methodsOfContributing.md "Contribution Guide Page")).

## Strategic Design

(WIP) [**Strategic Design**](strategic-design.md "Strategic Design Page") is the holy grail of fundamentals. It can take any team's performance and raise it significantly (with a solid support structure of students and mentors). Strategic design is about all the factors that go into what robot your team decides to build, creating a successful build season schedule for getting it done, and executing it well for competitions. It's about priorities and tradeoffs. It's about designing a robot and playing the game within your capabilities. 

## Hardware
These pages are all about robustness and designing with fabrication in mind. This means materials, types of structure, hardware, tolerances, and tools and machines.

(WIP) [**Materials**](structure/materials.md "Materials Page"): Different types of common materials in FRC and how to use them best, how to design for manufacturing, and a guide on lightening.

(WIP) [**Structure**](structure/structure.md "Structure Page"): A guide on creating robust and versatile robot structures. 
<!-- Covers different materials, techniques, and COTS components. -->
<!-- How to use materials in different forms and various COTS pieces to create a robust and versatile structure system. -->

## Power Transmission
These pages discuss the transmission of power to enable robot functionality.
<!-- This section is all about the transmission of power to enable different kinds of actions, whether that's a pivot that needs only two positions or a whole range, spinning things to bring a game piece in, or deploying a mechanism -->

(WIP) [**Motion Components**](power-transmission/motion-components.md "Motion Components Page"): A guide on bearings, bushings, axles, and the best use cases for them, including the mechanics behind transmission of torque through axles.

<!-- The basics of mechanical advantage, the transfer of torque and speed, and the differences and use for gears, belts, and chain. -->

(WIP) [**Linear Extension**](power-transmission/linear-extension.md "Linear Extension Page"): A guide on linear extension systems such as worm gears and rack and pinion.
<!-- Covers various linear extension systems such as worm gears and rack and pinion. -->

(WIP) [**Motors**](power-transmission/motors.md "Motors Page"): A guide on motors. Discusses motor selection and motor calculations.

(WIP) [**Wheels and Rollers**](power-transmission/wheels-rollers.md "Wheels and Rollers Page"): A extensive guide on wheels found in FRC. Discusses their mechanical properties and use cases.

(WIP) [**Pneumatics**](power-transmission/pneumatics.md "Pneumatics Page"): A guide on how and when to use pneumatics. 
<!-- An overview of how pneumatic systems work, the components required for one, and potential tradeoffs and use cases for pneumatics on a robot. -->

(WIP) [**Electronics and Sensors**](power-transmission/electronics-sensors.md "Electronics and Sensors Page"): A guide on how to design for electronics and incorporate sensors to improve the controllability.


## Mechanisms
