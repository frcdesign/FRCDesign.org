# Strategic Design

Strategic Design is the holy grail of fundamentals. It can take any team's performance and raise it significantly (with a solid support structure of students and mentors). Strategic design is about all the factors that go into what robot your team decides to build, creating a successful build season schedule for getting it done, and executing it well for competitions. It's about priorities and tradeoffs. It's about designing a robot and playing the game within your capabilities.

This page is not yet finished and will eventually be a full guide to strategic design, but for now, external resources are included and linked to for the content. There are many different elements to strategic design, and in this page they're formatted in the order you would do them in a build season.

Every robot's architecture can be mapped out on a whiteboard. Most teams don't compete at that actual level though (except for a few teams like 330 and 2056). Aim at lower ceilings, but really max those out (this basically just means that its fine to set less resource points, but you should be running at 100% of that theoretical capability.  If you try to go for something that has high ceilings and lower theoretical capability you're going to perform worse.)

You can't compare your robots for offseason to build season. Things that you were able to get performing well over the course of half a year simply cannot be compared to something done in a 10 week build season

More DOFS is very complicated and not necessarily bad. good questions to ask yourself when designing around DOF for handoffs, is do the actuations have to happen in an order.  This creates a level of coordination that needs to be implemented to do good...this can sound easy on a whiteboard, but actually very easy to struggle with. Additionally, how precise does controls have to be? If a very specific angle to score is needed, there are so many confounding variables that can mess this up(backlash, motor wear, chain/belt stretch, gear/pulley/sprocket wear, etc). Rotary joints can be very hard to control (more math and more math = bad). Linear so much easier, its literally just up / down

Make your bot very easy to maintain. Heard says that you should be able to reassemble your bot in the pits from raw parts (do NOT actually do this he says NOT to actually do this) and go to the match and everything should score at right heights etc. Additionally, what do you need to access in the pits? Do you need access holes in places? . How do you adjust your system?  Do you need external stuff like practice field, mock goals in pits, downloading code, swapping parts out, adjusting entire assemblies?

On kickoffs, you can estimate how long it takes to get to game pieces, get game piece, get to scoring area, aim and then score. (known as cycles). A good metric for estimations owuld be looking at previous years scouting data, watching videos...very important to not just use your memory!  If you're looking at previous years, its very reasonable to speed things up(Krakens and Falcons smurf CIMS = robot faster) Most mechanisms in FRC has probably been done before, and you can look at teams with similar resources / styles to yours and see what they did with a similar game. (this goes back to karthik designing within your capabilities)

Very important to iterate early on-> use your own prototypes, ri3d, other teams protos, cycle data analysis / vod reviews. Very good strategy to determine what to iterate, you need to step away and ask yourself was this prototype easier / harder than you thought it would be? And with that, does that make your cycle time estimations faster or slower than what it would be? (prototypes have to be like test prep... you need to actually dive into what can be improved, you cant just put 5 2x1 pieces together and call it a prototype if it never improves).

Now later in the season, AFTER you have hit that 100% theoretical capability as talked about earlier, you are able to do more complicated things. For example 973 did level 1 climber in 2019, but then did a fork climber for champs. They came to this decision by asking themselves: Whats the opportunity cost of the mechanism? How much would the bot be benefiting from this mechanism? Do i need to change a ton of stuff to implement this? "In frc theres merit to only making it as good as you need at the time you need it and saving everything for when it really
