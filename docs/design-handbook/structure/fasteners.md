# Fastener Standards

A guide on fasteners and fastener standards common in FRC.

## Bolts and Nuts

Modern FRC generally uses two different types of imperial bolts, #10-32 and 1/4-20. FRC COTS components primarily utilize 10-32 fasteners, and with a bit of effort, we can make robots that use almost exclusively 10-32 hardware. In general:

- 10-32 is used for almost everything: retaining shafts, screwing into motors, superstructure, etc.
- 1/4-20 is used for structural applications where more strength is required than #10 can provide. 

When designing around hardware, it is best to use the **hole tool**

- 10-32 hardware uses a hole diameter of **0.196 inches** for a standard fit
- 1/4-20 hardware uses a hole diameter of **0.257 inches** for a standard fit
