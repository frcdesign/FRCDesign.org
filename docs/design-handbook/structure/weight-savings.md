<!-- ## Pocketing and internal features

Pocketing is used to reduce weight from high-thickness, high density materials such as 3/16 or 1/4 aluminum. While thinner aluminum and plastics can also be pocketed, this is less common, and higher risk.

!!! Tip
    Pocketing always happens last. **Get design approval before pocketing**! Use [offset driven design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TT_QmZoUwG8) so your plates look decent **before** pocketing.

When pocketing, use the [part lighten featurescript](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/028ca8fb10baf53e1f6fce96/v/821c8b51ed0953526b51926e/e/a8b9e45297aac9f5688c871d).

- Tool radius must be â‰¥0.125 the radius of the cutting tool you use on your CNC, typically 0.125
- Strut thickness is usually 0.2 for 1/4 inch aluminum, and cut thru-all - but this depends on load and other factors -->
