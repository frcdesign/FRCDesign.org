# Materials

An overview of raw materials commonly found on FRC robots, including tips for handling them and use cases. This is specifically on materials used to make custom plates and parts, not necessarily COTS items. 

!!! Note
    For more information on materials used in 3D printing, like TPU or PLA, refer to the <a href="https://www.frcdesign.org/design-handbook/structure/intro-to-3d-printing/"target="_blank">Intro to 3D Printing</a> page for more information.

## Aluminum

Aluminum is one of the most versatile materials in FRC. It is both durable and easy to work with which means it's perfect for many applications. It's great for its cost; compared to other metals, it is relatively affordable. They are ideal for many applications where strength and structure are needed. In applications where this support isn't important, it may be more optimal to use a cheaper material like polycarbonate or to cut weight with SRPP. In addition, aluminum is not ideal for places where it extends beyond frame perimeter like intakes as it can easily bend or fail catastrophically. 

This section focuses on aluminum plates and blocks, however they are used everywhere in COTS and stock items like shafts, extrusions, etc. The thickness of the metal and type (6061 vs 7075) are important considerations as they each have different use cases.

### Sheet Thickness

Aluminum sheets can come in many thicknesses. The following are common thicknesses, however consider them as more ranges than single values.

**1/16" or 0.090":** Such thin metal is almost exclusively used for supports, like gussets or bellypans. Easy to route and use, it is very helpful in many cases.

**1/8":** 1/8" aluminum can play a variety of roles, from structural pieces to gussets. It can be more beneficial than 1/4" material because of its lower weight, however in cases involving high loads and forces, 1/4" is preferred.

!!! Tip
    For outer frame tubes on a drivetrain, it is best practice that they are 1/8" rather than 1/16" because of the large forces they'd experience from robot collisions.

**1/4":** Best thickness for anything structural, where strength is needed (i.e. high laod pivots).

### Alloy

Although many types of aluminum alloys exist, the most commonly used in FRC is **6061-T6** followed by **7075**. 6061 is best because of its ability to be both strong and easy to machine with. For most applications, it works well. However, in applications where more strength to handle higher loads is wanted, 7075 aluminum can be invaluable.

!!! Note
    7075 aluminum is used in many COTS items, notable solid hex shafts and gears. It is important to note the alloy on vendor websites if attemping to machine or modify COTS items. 

### Billet

Billet parts are blocks of metal that are machined through milling to remove part of it. They are usually made of 6061 aluminum. It is rare to see custom billet because of the difficulty in manufacturing for many teams, however they can be an important tool for many teams. Many COTS parts are made of billet material, such as tube plugs.

## Polycarbonate

Polycarbonate plastic is used in high impact applications such as subsystems that are exposed beyond the robot frame perimeter. Typically 1/4" thickness is used. 1/8 or 1/16" polycarbonate can be used for dust covers, sponsor panels, etc. - it will almost never shatter, and looks great.

!!! Tip
    "Smoked" or "tinted" polycarbonate can provide a more aesthetic look than clear. While making smoked polycarbonate is difficult, making frosted is easy! 30 seconds of sanding with an orbital sander using 240 grit will give the material a nice, glassy finish.


!!! Note
    Make sure to check your supplier's thickness and tolerance for each material. Sometimes, something marketed as in imperial measurements is actually manufactured to fit metric tolerances. For instance: 1/4" polycarbonate is actually sometimes manufactured as 6mm, which is 14 thousandths of an inch off of 1/4in. Account for these actual stock measurements when designing to make sure things end up fitting together!
