# Website Feature Guide

There are several features across the website that, if missed, will make it hard to go through the content effectively. The following features are shown with examples to help you gain a quick understanding of them before you make your way through the website.

## Across the Website

- [Links](learning-course/index.md "Learning Course Landing Page"){:target="\_blank"} are shown with green text
- Clicking on an image enlarges it and shows a caption, if applicable. Press the `Esc` key to minimize it again.
- The website has a [glossary](resources/glossary.md "Glossary Page"){:target="\_blank"} of terms related to the content. Whenever a word in that glossary is mentioned in the website, it will be underlined. You can hover over these underlined words to get a quick definition (e.g. COTS, OTB).
- Some information is hidden in dropdowns. Try to check most of them!
