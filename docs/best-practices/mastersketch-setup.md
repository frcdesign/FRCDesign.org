# Master Sketch Best Practices

Mastersketches (layout sketches) drive the core geometry of the entire robot.

Think:

- Drivebase dimensions
- Bumper height
- End-effector wheel locations based off of prototyping
- Intake wheel locations
- Basic serializer geometry

NOT:

- Specific details like the shape of plates
- Motor mounting locations
  
Effective mastersketching requires you to stay organized. This means:

- Multiple sketches, usually one per subsystem, within the mastersketches part studio. Keep everything separate!
- Name your sketches accordingly
- Start with the drivetrain, then extension limits, then field elements to build off on
- Sketch all the possible states of each moving subsystem 

In general, mastersketching is an art that can require some practice to get the hang of. [This tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd_XzBw5V_U) can help you get started if you are unsure.
